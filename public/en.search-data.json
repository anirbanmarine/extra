Based on the concept of prior informed consent, it requires that, before an export may take place, the authorities of the State of export notify the authorities of the prospective States of import and transit, providing them with detailed information on the intended movement.\nThe movement may only proceed if and when all States concerned have given their written consent (articles 6 and 7). The Basel Convention also provides for cooperation between parties, ranging from exchange of information on issues relevant to the implementation of the Convention to technical assistance, particularly to developing countries (articles 10 and 13). The Secretariat is required to facilitate and support this cooperation, acting as a clearing-house (article 16). In the event of a transboundary movement of hazardous wastes having been carried out illegally, i.e. in contravention of the provisions of articles 6 and 7, or cannot be completed as foreseen, the Convention attributes responsibility to one or more of the States involved, and imposes the duty to ensure safe disposal, either by re-import into the State of generation or otherwise (articles 8 and 9). The Convention also provides for the establishment of regional or sub-regional centres for training and technology transfers regarding the management of hazardous wastes and other wastes and the minimization of their generation to cater to the specific needs of different regions and subregions (article 14). Fourteen such centres have been established. They carry out training and capacity building activities in the regions. ","how-is-it-implemented#How is it implemented?":"What is it? The Basel Convention on the Control of Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes and their Disposal, 1989 is an international treaty that aims to protect human health and the environment against the adverse effects of hazardous wastes. It was adopted on 22 March 1989 and entered into force on 5 May 1992. As of October 1, 2023, it has 189 parties.\nThe Convention covers a wide range of wastes, including toxic, poisonous, explosive, corrosive, flammable, ecotoxic, and infectious wastes. It also covers two types of wastes defined as \u0026ldquo;other wastes\u0026rdquo; - household waste and incinerator ash.\nThe Convention regulates the transboundary movement of hazardous wastes and other wastes and obliges its parties to ensure that such wastes are managed and disposed of in an environmentally sound manner. Parties have an obligation to minimize the quantities that are transported, to treat and dispose of wastes as close as possible to their place of generation, and to prevent or minimize the generation of wastes at source.\nThe Convention also prohibits the export of hazardous wastes from developed countries to developing countries. This is known as the \u0026ldquo;ban amendment\u0026rdquo; and it was adopted in 1995.\nHow is it implemented? The Basel Convention is implemented through a system of prior informed consent (PIC), which requires parties to notify each other and obtain consent before shipping hazardous wastes and other wastes across borders. The Convention also establishes a number of other measures to control the transboundary movement of hazardous wastes, including a requirement for packaging, labeling, and transport in accordance with international standards.\nThe Basel Convention has played an important role in reducing the transboundary movement of hazardous wastes and protecting human health and the environment. However, there are still a number of challenges that need to be addressed, such as the illegal trafficking of hazardous wastes and the management of hazardous wastes in developing countries.\n","milestones#Milestones":" 1989 Adopted on 22 March\n1995 The Ban Amendment\n1998 Annexes 8 and 9 adopted\n1999 Basel protocol on Liability and Compensation, Committee for administering and implementation established 2002 interim guidelines for technical Cooperation\n2008 MPPI(Mobile phone partnership initiative), Action for partnership on Computing Equipment(PACE), The Bali Declaration on Waste Management for Human Health and Livelihood 2010 ExCOPs( extraordinary Conference of Parties) Bali\nSince its adoption, the Basel Convention has seen a number of significant developments.\nThe Amendment to the Convention on the Con­trol of Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes and their Disposal (“the Ban Amendment”) was adopted by the third meeting of the Conference of the Parties (COP) in 1995. The Ban Amendment provides for the prohibition of ex­ports of all hazardous wastes covered by the Convention that are intended for final disposal, reuse, recycling and recovery from countries listed in annex VII to the Convention (Parties and other States which are members of the OECD, EC, Liechtenstein) to all oth­er countries. As at 1 January 2011, the Ban Amendment has not yet entered into force. The challenge of protecting vulnerable countries from unwanted hazardous waste imports, while not precluding the import of wastes considered valuable secondary raw materials to countries in a position to manage them in an environmentally sound manner has therefore gained importance. Informal discussions were initiated at COP 9 in 2008 to identify a way to enable the entry into force of the Ban Amendment while addressing the concerns and needs of all countries in this context.\nAnnexes VIII and IX to the Convention, which provide further elaboration as to the wastes regulated by the Convention as listed in Annexes I and III were adopted by COP 4 in 1998.\nThe Basel Protocol on Liability and Compensation for Damage resulting from Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes and their Disposal was adopted by COP 5 in 1999. The Basel Protocol regulates civil liability for damage resulting from the transboundary movement of hazardous wastes and other wastes, including incidents occurring as a result of illegal traffic. As at 1 January 2011, the Basel Protocol has not yet entered into force. Delegates at COP 5 also agreed on an interim arrangement to cover emergency situations until the Protocol en­ters into force. COP 6 in 2002 approved the Interim Guidelines for the Implementa­tion of decision V/32 on the Enlargement of the scope of the Technical Cooperation Trust Fund.\nA Committee for Administering the Mechanism for Promoting Implementation and Compliance was established at COP 6 in Geneva in 2002. The objective of this mechanism is to assist parties to comply with their obligations under the Convention and to facilitate, promote, monitor and aim to secure the implementation of, and compliance with, the obligations under the Convention. The mechanism is non-confrontational, transparent, cost-effective and preventive in nature, simple, flexible, non-binding and oriented in the direction of helping parties to implement the provisions of the Basel Convention.\nOne of the most important contributions of the Basel Convention over the past 20 years is the elaboration of a significant number of policy instruments with non-binding character. Within the framework of the Convention, a large body of technical guidelines on the management of specific waste streams has been developed by technical government expert groups and approved by the COP. These non-binding instruments have been designed for the use of Governments at all levels, as well as other stakeholders, to provide practical guidance and thus facilitate the management of the relevant waste streams.\nIn 2002, COP 6 adopted the Strategic Plan for the implementation of the Basel Convention for the period 2002 to 2010, to assist developing countries and countries with economies in transition in implementing the provisions of the Convention. Numerous national and regional capacity building and training projects have since been implemented under the umbrella of the Strategic Plan, with the assistance of the Secretariat and the Basel Convention Regional Centres. COP 10 in October 2011 is expected to adopt a new strategic framework for the period 2011 to 2021, defining the fundamental aims and priorities of the Convention for the relevant decade while taking into account changes that have occurred since its adoption.\nCOP 6 also established a partnership programme with business and industry. Under this programme, two public-private partnerships have thus far been successfully launched, both with the objective of developing specific technical guidelines – to be used by the relevant industry and authorities for the management of end-of-life electronic devices and electronic waste – and initiating relevant pilot projects at country level, including in companies. Between 2003 and 2008, the Mobile Phone Partnership Initiative (MPPI) developed guidelines for every stage of the management of end-of-life mobile phones, which are being used in relevant facilities. 2008 saw the inception of the Partnership for Action on Computing Equipment (PACE) by COP 9. Building on experience gained with the MPPI, PACE is working to increase the environmentally sound management of used and end-of-life computing equipment.\nThe Bali Declaration on Waste Management for Human Health and Livelihood, adopted by COP 9 in 2008, has affirmed at the political level that waste, if not managed in a safe and environmentally sound manner, may have serious consequences for the environment, human health and sustainable livelihood. The commitment agreed by Ministers in the Bali Declaration to prevent the illegal transboundary movement of hazardous wastes, minimize the generation of hazardous wastes and promote the safe and environmentally sound management of waste within each country has since been supported by other international organizations. Following the UNEP Governing Council / Global Ministerial Environment Forum in 2009, the World Health Assembly in May 2010 and the Human Rights Council in June 2010 also highlighted the link between toxic waste, human health, and the enjoyment of human rights.\nRecently, the management of hazardous chemicals and wastes has moved up on the international political agenda in the context of environmental governance. This is in no small part due to what has become known as the “synergies” process between the Basel, Rotterdam Convention on the Prior Informed Consent Procedure for Certain Hazardous Chemicals and Pesticides in International Trade and the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants. Several years of deliberations through a Party-led process culminated in the successful simultaneous extraordinary meetings of the Conferences of the Parties to the Basel, Rotterdam and Stockholm conventions (ExCOPs) took place in Bali from 22 to 24 February 2010. A “first” in the history of international treaties and the highlight of the synergies process thus far, the ExCOPs gave directions for countries to implement the three conventions in a more holistic and coordinated way. The conventions have joined forces to better address the challenge of environmentally sound management of hazardous substances at different stages of their life cycle.\nThe Basel Convention celebrated its 20th anniversary in 2009 – an event commemorated in November 2009 in Basel (Switzerland). On this occasion, Kenya, Indonesia, and Colombia, the past, present and future Presidents of the COP, together with Switzerland as the host of the Diplomatic Conference in 1989, launched the Basel Waste Solutions Circle, an initiative showcasing projects at all levels that contribute in a concrete manner to the implementation of the Bali Declaration.\nOver the past 20 years, the Basel Convention has had ample occasion to adjust to new global developments and needs with regards to waste management over the years, and has risen to these challenges. With the added benefit of closer cooperation with the Rotterdam and Stockholm conventions, the Convention now has the potential to start considering wastes more in a life cycle context. This will make it possible to embrace new ways of thinking.\nThe Basel Convention plays a decisive role in achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) - poverty reduction, reducing child mortality, improving maternal health, ensure environmental sustainability. Waste minimization undoubtedly leads us to achieving the MDGs. In addition, state-of-the art recycling in accordance with agreed standards could create business opportunities and safe jobs; a higher yield of secondary raw materials; conservation of precious resources through extraction and re-use rather than primary mining; and better protection of the air, soil, water and thus human health. Realizing this potential might also lessen the incentives for illegal recycling operations, through providing legal, safe and economically rewarding alternatives.\n","objective#Objective":"The overarching objective of the Basel Convention is to protect human health and the environment against the adverse effects of hazardous wastes. Its scope of application covers a wide range of wastes defined as “hazardous wastes” based on their origin and/or composition and their characteristics, as well as two types of wastes defined as “other wastes” - household waste and incinerator ash.","overview#Overview":"The Basel Convention on the Control of Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes and their Disposal was adopted on 22 March 1989 by the Conference of Plenipotentiaries in Basel, Switzerland, in response to a public outcry following the discovery, in the 1980s, in Africa and other parts of the developing world of deposits of toxic wastes imported from abroad.\nAwakening environmental awareness and corresponding tightening of environmental regulations in the industrialized world in the 1970s and 1980s had led to increasing public resistance to the disposal of hazardous wastes – in accordance with what became known as the NIMBY (Not In My Back Yard) syndrome – and to an escalation of disposal costs. This in turn led some operators to seek cheap disposal options for hazardous wastes in Eastern Europe and the developing world, where environmental awareness was much less developed and regulations and enforcement mechanisms were lacking. It was against this background that the Basel Convention was negotiated in the late 1980s, and its thrust at the time of its adoption was to combat the “toxic trade”, as it was termed. The Convention entered into force in 1992.\n","what-are-the-key-achievements#What are the key achievements?":"Here are some of the key achievements of the Basel Convention:\nThe ban on the export of hazardous wastes from developed countries to developing countries has helped to protect developing countries from the dumping of hazardous wastes. The PIC system has helped to ensure that parties are aware of and have a say in the transboundary movement of hazardous wastes. The Convention has promoted the development of environmentally sound waste management practices in developing countries. The Basel Convention is an important tool for protecting human health and the environment from the adverse effects of hazardous wastes. It is essential that all parties continue to work together to implement the Convention effectively.

It entered into force in 2005 and has been ratified by 192 countries, including India.\nThe Kyoto Protocol is the first international treaty to set binding targets for the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. It commits developed countries to reduce their emissions by an average of 5.2% below 1990 levels by the first commitment period, 2008-2012.\nThe Kyoto Protocol includes a number of mechanisms to help countries achieve their emissions targets, including:\nEmissions trading: Countries can trade emissions permits with each other, so that countries that can reduce their emissions more cheaply can sell permits to countries that find it more difficult or expensive to reduce their emissions. Joint implementation: Countries can work together to implement projects that reduce emissions in other countries. Clean development mechanism: Developed countries can invest in projects that reduce emissions in developing countries, and then count the emissions reductions towards their own targets. The Kyoto Protocol has played an important role in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and promoting international cooperation on climate change. However, it has also been criticized for not being ambitious enough and for not including all major emitters, such as the United States. Here are some of the key achievements of the Kyoto Protocol:\nThe Kyoto Protocol has helped to raise awareness of the importance of reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The Kyoto Protocol has established a global framework for international cooperation on climate change. The Kyoto Protocol has promoted the development of new technologies and markets for clean energy and energy efficiency. The Kyoto Protocol has helped to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from developed countries. The Kyoto Protocol is an important tool for addressing climate change. However, it is important to note that the first commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol ended in 2012 and that a new agreement, the Paris Agreement, was adopted in 2015. The Paris Agreement sets out a new framework for international cooperation on climate change, with the goal of limiting the global temperature rise to well below 2 degrees Celsius, preferably to 1.5 degrees Celsius, compared to pre-industrial levels.

They are characterized by a central region of low atmospheric pressure and strong winds that rotate in a counterclockwise direction in the Northern Hemisphere and clockwise direction in the Southern Hemisphere.\nHow is a cyclonic storm formed?\nThe formation of cyclonic storms is a complex process that requires a number of factors to come together, including:\nWarm ocean waters: Cyclonic storms need warm ocean waters (at least 26°C or 79°F) to form and develop. The warm water provides the energy that drives the storm. Low wind shear: Cyclonic storms also need low wind shear, which is the change in wind direction and speed with altitude. High wind shear can disrupt the storm\u0026rsquo;s circulation and prevent it from developing. Atmospheric instability: Cyclonic storms also need atmospheric instability, which is a condition in which the atmosphere is prone to rising air. Rising air can cool and condense, forming clouds and rain. Once these conditions are met, a cyclonic storm can begin to form. The process typically starts with a small disturbance in the atmosphere, such as a wave on a weather front. As the disturbance grows, it begins to draw in warm, moist air from the surrounding ocean. This air rises and cools, forming clouds and rain. The rising air also releases latent heat, which further energizes the storm.\nAs the storm continues to grow, it develops a central region of low atmospheric pressure. This low pressure draws in even more air, which causes the winds to strengthen. The storm also develops a characteristic eye, which is a region of calm, clear air in the center of the storm.\nCyclonic storms can reach wind speeds of over 250 kilometers per hour (155 miles per hour). They can also produce heavy rains and storm surges that can cause significant damage.\n","forecasting-of-tropical-cyclones-has-improved-greatly-in-recent-years#Forecasting of tropical cyclones has improved greatly in recent years.":"There are certain areas over the oceans that are particularly favourable for tropical cyclone development, but it is usually certain characteristics in a cluster of thunderclouds that leads forecasters to recognise them as tropical depressions. This is done by people at specialist tropical cyclone forecasting centres around the globe such as the National Hurricane Center in Miami, Florida who are constantly studying satellite images, instruments and other weather data to detect and track them through their life-cycle. Once detected, their track is forecast using a combination of numerical forecasting models, synoptic forecasting and statistical methods, which have been developed from the study of the behaviour of past storms.\nObservations from ships at sea are always very useful, although, once the existence of a storm and its forecast track have been broadcast, ships tend to move out of their way! Reinforced aircraft, fitted with instruments, fly through and over tropical cyclones, and weather radar can locate storms within 200 miles of the radar station. In addition, tropical cyclones are tracked by satellites, which provide very useful information both to forecasters and numerical forecast models.\n\u0026ldquo;Official\u0026rdquo; responsibility for forecasting tropical cyclones in the areas affected lies with the regional centres such as the National Hurricane Center in Miami. However, the Met Office does produce tropical cyclone forecasts from its global model, which are disseminated to the regional centres. They then use these forecasts, along with other forms of guidance, to produce their forecasts. Met Office forecasts of tropical cyclones show considerable skill and are among the best models available to agencies such as the National Hurricane Center.\n","here-are-the-stages-of-cyclone-formation#Here are the stages of cyclone formation:":" Incipient disturbance: This is the early stage of development, when a small disturbance in the atmosphere begins to form. Tropical depression: The disturbance develops into a tropical depression when the winds reach speeds of at least 35 kilometers per hour (22 miles per hour). Tropical storm: The tropical depression becomes a tropical storm when the winds reach speeds of at least 65 kilometers per hour (40 miles per hour). Hurricane: The tropical storm becomes a hurricane when the winds reach speeds of at least 119 kilometers per hour (74 miles per hour). Cyclonic storms can continue to intensify after they reach hurricane strength. The strongest hurricanes can have wind speeds of over 300 kilometers per hour (186 miles per hour).\nCyclonic storms are a major natural hazard, and they can cause significant damage to life and property. It is important to be aware of the risks posed by cyclones and to have a plan in place if a cyclone is approaching your area.\n","measuring-tropical-cyclones#Measuring tropical cyclones":"In order to categorise tropical cyclones around the world, the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale is used defining events by their wind speed and impacts.\nAlthough developed in the USA, tropical cyclones around the world are measured by the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale which originated from 1971 with Herbert Saffir, a civil engineer and Bob Simpson of the US National Hurricane Center.\nThe Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale consists of a five point scale of hurricane intensity and starts at 74 mph. Tropical cyclones with wind speeds up to 38 mph are classified as tropical depressions and those with wind speeds from 39 - 73 mph are classified as tropical storms.\nIt is important to note that whilst the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale defines wind strengths and their likely impacts, severe impacts from tropical cyclones can also occur due to storm surge and heavy rain which are not necessarily directly related to the strength of the wind in the tropical cyclone.\nSaffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale Category 1 Wind (mph): 74 - 95\nDamage: Minimal - No significant structural damage, can uproot trees and cause some flooding in coastal areas.\nCategory 2 Wind (mph): 96 - 110\nModerate - No major destruction to buildings, can uproot trees and signs. Coastal flooding can occur. Secondary effects can include the shortage of water and electricity.\nCategory 3 Wind (mph): 111 - 129\nExtensive - Structural damage to small buildings and serious coastal flooding to those on low lying land. Evacuation may be needed.\nCategory 4 Wind (mph): 130-156\nExtreme - All signs and trees blown down with extensive damage to roofs. Flat land inland may become flooded. Evacuation probable.\nCategory 5 Wind (mph): greater than 156\nCatastrophic - Buildings destroyed with small buildings being overturned. All trees and signs blown down. Evacuation of up to 10 miles inland\n","rapid-intensification-of-cyclonic-storm#Rapid intensification of Cyclonic storm":"What is rapid intensification of a cyclonic storm?\nCyclonic storms can intensify rapidly, increasing in wind speed and size in a short period of time. This process is known as rapid intensification. The United States National Hurricane Center defines rapid intensification as an increase in the maximum sustained winds of a tropical cyclone of at least 30 knots (35 mph; 55 km/h) in a 24-hour period.\nThere are a number of factors that can contribute to the intensification of a cyclonic storm, including:\nWarm ocean waters: Cyclonic storms need warm ocean waters to intensify. The warm water provides the energy that drives the storm. Low wind shear: Cyclonic storms also need low wind shear to intensify. High wind shear can disrupt the storm\u0026rsquo;s circulation and prevent it from developing. Atmospheric instability: Cyclonic storms also need atmospheric instability to intensify. This is a condition in which the atmosphere is prone to rising air. Rising air can cool and condense, forming clouds and rain. Other factors that can contribute to rapid intensification include:\nThe presence of a mesoscale convective vortex (MCV): An MCV is a small rotating area of thunderstorms within a tropical cyclone. MCVs can help to enhance the cyclone\u0026rsquo;s circulation and lead to rapid intensification. The presence of a brown ocean vortex (BOV): A BOV is a swirling mass of warm water that can form beneath a tropical cyclone. BOVs can provide additional energy to the cyclone, helping it to intensify more quickly. Rapid intensification can be a dangerous process, as it can make it difficult for forecasters to predict the storm\u0026rsquo;s track and intensity. It can also lead to unexpected and severe impacts on coastal communities. In recent years, there has been a trend towards more rapid intensification of tropical cyclones. This is thought to be due to a combination of factors, including climate change, which is leading to warmer ocean waters, and natural variability.\nScientists are working to better understand the factors that contribute to rapid intensification and to develop improved forecasting methods. This will help to reduce the risk of loss of life and property from tropical cyclones.\n"},"title":"Cyclonic Storms"},"/extra/docs/partc/em301/meteorology/el-nino/":{"data":{"":"","can-volcanic-eruptions-cause-el-niño-maybe-maybe-not#Can volcanic eruptions cause El Niño?

El Niño and La Niña are opposite extremes of the ENSO, which refers to cyclical environmental conditions that occur across the Equatorial Pacific Ocean. These changes are due to natural interactions between the ocean and atmosphere. Sea surface temperature, rainfall, air pressure, atmospheric and ocean circulation all influence each other. A satellite image of the Earth showing an abnormally warm area near the equator off the West Coast of South America. Satellite sea surface temperature departure in the Pacific Ocean for the month of October 2015, where darker orange-red colors are above normal temperatures and are indicative of El Niño. (Image credit: NOAA)\n!(PHOTO El Nino.png)\nWhat is El Niño? What is La Niña? An El Niño condition occurs when surface water in the equatorial Pacific becomes warmer than average and east winds blow weaker than normal. The opposite condition is called La Niña. During this phase of ENSO, the water is cooler than normal and the east winds are stronger. El Niños typically occur every 3 to 5 years.\nENSO-Neutral or average conditions across the tropical Pacific Ocean. Climate.gov schematic by Emily Eng and inspired by NOAA PMEL. The rise of El Niño and La Niña How do El Niño and La Niña events form and increase in strength? The key is in the ocean-atmosphere coupling across the tropical Pacific Ocean.\nHow ENSO impacts humans? El Niño, La Niña, and the neutral condition all produce important consequences for people and ecosystems across the globe. The interactions between the ocean and atmosphere alters weather around the world and can result in severe storms or mild weather, drought or flooding. Beyond “just” influencing the weather, these changes can produce secondary results that influence food supplies and prices, forest fires, and create additional economic and political consequences. Famines and political strife can result from these environmental conditions.\n(top) The sea surface temperature (shaded contours), 10-meter wind (vectors), and (bottom) rainfall departures from average in June – August during an average Atlantic Niño. The gray dots in the bottom panel indicate that the rainfall departures are statistically significant (5% significance level), indicating a high degree of confidence that the rainfall departures are associated with Atlantic Niño. Climate.gov figure adapted from Vallès‐Casanova et al. (2020). Do you know that El Niño has a little brother? His name is Atlantic Niño, and he has an uncanny resemblance to his big brother: Like El Niño, Atlantic Niño is characterized by warmer-than-average sea surface temperatures in the eastern equatorial basin and weaker-than-average trade winds throughout the east-central equatorial Atlantic. What are some of ENSO\u0026rsquo;s impacts? Ecosystems and human communities can be positively or negatively affected. For example, in the Southern United States, during the fall through spring, El Niño usually causes increased rainfall and sometimes destructive flooding. La Niña, however, usually causes drier weather in the South, but the Northwest tends to be colder and wetter than average. Even though El Niño occurs in the Pacific Ocean, it often reduces the number of hurricanes that form in the Atlantic Ocean. Conversely, La Niña events tend to be related to an increase in the number of Atlantic hurricanes.\nFood production is impacted by ENSO. Changes in ocean temperatures and currents that happen during El Niño impact marine life. This can impact individuals who make a living fishing and consumers who depend on certain fish for food. Agriculture is of course very dependent on climate and weather, as a result ENSO’s influence on rainfall and temperature have important consequences for food production and availability.\nRedoubt Volcano viewed from the northwest following the April 4, 2009 eruption. Credit: R. G. McGimsey, USGS.\nCan volcanic eruptions cause El Niño? Maybe, maybe not Volcanic eruptions have had HUGE impacts on the global climate by cooling Earth. It’s only natural to wonder, if the planet is affected by volcanic eruptions, can ENSO be? The origin of the name The origin of the name “El Niño” dates to the 1800’s, when fishermen on the Pacific coast of South America would notice that a warm ocean current would appear every few years. Fish catches would drop drastically, negatively affecting the food supply and livelihood of the communities of coastal Peru. This warm water would arrive around Christmastime. Referring to the birth of Christ, they named the warm ocean waters, El Niño, which means “the boy” in Spanish. Fishing in this region is best during La Niña years when cold upwelling ocean water brings rich nutrientsoffsite link from the deep ocean, resulting in an increase in the number of fish caught.\nThe Southern Oscillation is a coherent interannual fluctuation of atmospheric pressure over the tropical Indo-Pacific region\nIt is the atmospheric component of a single large-scale coupled interaction called the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) The Southern Oscillation describes changes in air pressure patterns in the Southern Pacific Ocean between Tahiti, in the middle of the southern Pacific Ocean, and Darwin, Australia, to the west 2. Normally, lower pressure over Darwin and higher pressure over Tahiti encourages air movement from east to west 2. The Southern Oscillation Index (SOI) tracks the atmospheric part of the ENSO pattern 3.

A stable atmosphere is one in which vertical motion is suppressed, while an unstable atmosphere is one in which vertical motion is enhanced.\nWhat does Meteorological Stability depend upon?\nThe stability of the atmosphere is determined by a number of factors, including:\nTemperature: The temperature of the air decreases with altitude. If the air temperature decreases more slowly than the environmental temperature, the air parcel will be warmer than the surrounding air and will rise. This is known as instability. If the air temperature decreases more quickly than the environmental temperature, the air parcel will be cooler than the surrounding air and will sink. This is known as stability. Moisture: Water vapor is less dense than dry air. This means that a rising air parcel that is saturated with water vapor will be less dense than the surrounding air and will continue to rise. This is known as conditional instability. Wind shear: Wind shear is the change in wind speed or direction with altitude. Wind shear can destabilize the atmosphere by creating turbulence. Why is Meteorological stability Important?\nMeteorological stability is important for a number of reasons.\nFirst, it affects the development of clouds and precipitation. Stable atmospheres are less likely to produce clouds and precipitation, while unstable atmospheres are more likely to produce clouds and precipitation.\nSecond, meteorological stability affects the severity of weather events. For example, thunderstorms are more likely to develop in unstable atmospheres.\nThird, meteorological stability affects the transport of pollutants. Stable atmospheres can trap pollutants near the ground, while unstable atmospheres can transport pollutants higher into the atmosphere.\nWhat are the tools used by Meterologists to assess meteorological stability?\nMeteorologists use a variety of tools to assess meteorological stability, including:\nTemperature and dew point soundings: Temperature and dew point soundings are used to measure the temperature and moisture of the air at different altitudes. This information can be used to calculate the environmental lapse rate and the moist adiabatic lapse rate, which can then be used to assess stability. Wind shear profiles: Wind shear profiles are used to measure the change in wind speed or direction with altitude. This information can be used to assess the destabilizing effect of wind shear. Satellite imagery: Satellite imagery can be used to identify cloud patterns and other features that can be indicative of stability or instability. Meteorologists use information about meteorological stability to create weather forecasts and to issue warnings about hazardous weather conditions. ","numerical-meteorological-prediction-nwp#Numerical meteorological prediction (NWP)":"What is a Numerical meteorological prediction (NWP)? Numerical meteorological prediction (NWP) is a method of forecasting the weather by using mathematical models of the atmosphere and oceans. NWP models use the laws of physics to simulate the atmosphere and oceans and to predict how they will change over time.\nNWP models are typically run on supercomputers, which are required to perform the billions of calculations necessary to produce a forecast. NWP models are initialized with current weather observations, which are collected from a variety of sources, including weather stations, aircraft, and satellites.\nOnce the model is initialized, it is run forward in time to produce a forecast. The forecast includes a variety of weather elements, such as temperature, precipitation, wind, and cloud cover.\nNWP models are constantly being improved as scientists learn more about the atmosphere and oceans. NWP models are now able to produce accurate forecasts for a variety of weather events, including thunderstorms, hurricanes, and winter storms.\nWhat are the uses of NWP? NWP forecasts are used by a variety of people and organizations, including:\nMeteorologists: Meteorologists use NWP forecasts to create weather forecasts for the public. Aviation: Pilots and other aviation professionals use NWP forecasts to plan flights. Shipping: Ship captains and other maritime professionals use NWP forecasts to plan voyages. Agriculture: Farmers and other agricultural professionals use NWP forecasts to make decisions about planting, harvesting, and irrigation. Energy: Energy companies use NWP forecasts to predict demand and to plan operations. NWP is a powerful tool for forecasting the weather and for making informed decisions about a variety of activities. NWP models are constantly being improved and are becoming more accurate all the time. What are some of the challenges of NWP?\nThe atmosphere is a complex system. There are a large number of factors that can influence the weather, and it is difficult to model all of these factors perfectly. Weather observations are not perfect. Weather observations are collected from a variety of sources, and the quality of these observations can vary. This can lead to errors in the model\u0026rsquo;s initial conditions. Computers have limited power. Even supercomputers are not powerful enough to simulate the atmosphere and oceans perfectly. This means that NWP models have to make approximations, which can lead to errors in the forecast. Despite these challenges, NWP is a very useful tool for forecasting the weather. NWP forecasts are used by a variety of people and organizations to make informed decisions about a variety of activities.\n","streamline-and-isotach-analysis#Streamline and isotach analysis":" ℹ️ What is Streamline and isotach analysis?\nStreamline and isotach analysis is a method of representing the wind field at a given level in the atmosphere. Streamlines are lines that are tangent to the wind at every point. Isotachs are lines of equal wind speed.\nWhat is Streamline and isotach analysis used for?\nStreamline and isotach analysis is useful for identifying a variety of weather features, including:\nFronts: Fronts are boundaries between air masses with different temperature and moisture characteristics. Streamline and isotach analysis can be used to identify the location of fronts and to determine the direction in which they are moving.\nCyclones and anticyclones: Cyclones and anticyclones are large-scale areas of low and high pressure, respectively. Streamline and isotach analysis can be used to identify the location of cyclones and anticyclones and to determine their strength and direction of movement.\nJet streams: Jet streams are narrow bands of strong wind that occur high in the atmosphere. Streamline and isotach analysis can be used to identify the location of jet streams and to determine their strength and direction of movement.\nStreamline and isotach analysis is also useful for forecasting weather. For example, meteorologists can use streamline and isotach analysis to predict where and when precipitation is likely to occur.\nHow is Streamline and isotach analysis done?\nTo create a streamline and isotach analysis, meteorologists use wind observations from weather stations and aircraft. They first plot the wind observations on a map. Then, they draw streamlines and isotachs connecting the wind observations.\nStreamlines are typically drawn at regular intervals, such as every 5 or 10 degrees. Isotachs are typically drawn at intervals of 5 or 10 knots.\nOnce the streamlines and isotachs have been drawn, meteorologists can begin to analyze the wind field. For example, they can look for areas where the streamlines are converging or diverging. Convergence of streamlines indicates an area where air is accumulating, which can lead to precipitation. Divergence of streamlines indicates an area where air is spreading out, which can lead to clear skies.\nMeteorologists can also look for areas where the isotachs are close together. This indicates an area where the wind is strong. Areas where the isotachs are far apart indicate an area where the wind is weak.\nStreamline and isotach analysis is a powerful tool for understanding and forecasting the weather. It is used by meteorologists around the world to create weather maps and forecasts.\n","synoptic-representation-of-pressure-field-contour-and-thickness-charts#Synoptic representation of pressure field, contour and thickness charts":"What are Synoptic Charts? Synoptic representation of pressure field, contour and thickness charts are a way to represent the current state of the atmosphere on a map.\nℹ️ Pressure field chart: A pressure field chart shows the distribution of atmospheric pressure at a given time. Pressure field charts are typically used to identify and track weather systems, such as fronts, cyclones, and anticyclones.\nContour chart: A contour chart shows the height of a given pressure surface above sea level. Contour charts are typically used to identify and track upper-level weather systems, such as jet streams and troughs.\nThickness chart: A thickness chart shows the difference in height between two pressure surfaces. Thickness charts are typically used to identify and track areas of warm and cold air, which can lead to precipitation and other weather events.\nWhat are synoptic charts used for? Synoptic charts are used by meteorologists to create weather forecasts and to study the atmosphere. They are also used by pilots and other aviation professionals to plan flights.\nℹ️ How to interpret synoptic charts?\nHere is a brief description of how to interpret synoptic charts:\nPressure field chart: The higher the pressure, the closer the air molecules are together and the heavier the air is. This makes high-pressure areas more stable and less likely to produce precipitation. Low-pressure areas are the opposite, with lower pressure and less stable air. Low-pressure areas are more likely to produce precipitation and other weather events, such as thunderstorms and tornadoes.\nContour chart: The closer the contour lines are together, the steeper the slope of the pressure surface. This means that the wind will be stronger in areas where the contour lines are closer together.\nThickness chart: Areas of warm air have a higher thickness than areas of cold air. This is because warm air expands and takes up more space than cold air. Thickness charts can be used to identify areas where there is a strong temperature gradient, which can lead to precipitation and other weather events.\nSynoptic charts can be complex and difficult to interpret, but they are a valuable tool for meteorologists and other professionals who need to understand the current state of the atmosphere.\n","synoptic-weather-observations#Synoptic weather observations":"Synoptic weather observations are observations of the atmosphere that are made at regular intervals, typically every three or six hours, at a global network of weather stations. These observations are used by meteorologists to create weather maps and forecasts.\nSynoptic weather observations typically include the following elements:\nTemperature: The air temperature at the time of the observation. Dew point: The temperature at which the air would become saturated with water vapor and condensation would occur. Wind speed and direction: The speed and direction of the wind at the time of the observation. Atmospheric pressure: The pressure of the atmosphere at the time of the observation. Cloud cover: The amount and type of cloud cover present at the time of the observation. Visibility: The horizontal distance at which objects can be clearly seen at the time of the observation. Precipitation: The type and amount of precipitation that has fallen since the previous observation. In addition to these basic elements, synoptic weather observations may also include other information, such as the presence of fog, thunderstorms, or other weather phenomena.\nImportance of Synoptic Weather Observation Systems\nSynoptic weather observations are important for a number of reasons. First, they provide meteorologists with a snapshot of the current state of the atmosphere. This information is used to create weather maps and forecasts, which help people to plan their daily activities and make informed decisions about their safety.\nSecond, synoptic weather observations can be used to track the movement of weather systems, such as fronts, cyclones, and anticyclones. This information can be used to predict where and when these weather systems will bring precipitation, thunderstorms, and other hazardous weather conditions.\nThird, synoptic weather observations are used to study the climate. By comparing weather observations from different time periods, scientists can identify trends in temperature, precipitation, and other weather elements. This information can be used to understand how the climate is changing and to predict how it will change in the future.\nSynoptic weather observations are collected by a variety of sources, including:\nStaffed weather stations: Staffed weather stations are operated by trained meteorologists who make manual observations of the atmosphere. Automated weather stations: Automated weather stations use sensors to collect weather data without human intervention. Aircraft: Aircraft also collect weather data, which is used to supplement the data collected from surface-based weather stations. Ships: Ships also collect weather data, which is used to provide information about the weather over the oceans. Synoptic weather observations are transmitted to weather forecasting centers around the world, where they are used to create weather maps and forecasts. These forecasts are then disseminated to the public through a variety of channels, such as television, radio, and the internet.\n"},"title":"Meteorological Observation Systems"},"/extra/docs/partc/em301/meteorology/wind_effects/":{"data":{"":"","convergence#Convergence":"What is wind convergence? Wind effects convergence refer to the effects of horizontal winds on the convergence of air. Convergence is a measure of how much air is flowing towards a given point. It is calculated as the sum of the changes in the wind speed in the x, y, and z directions. Wind effects convergence can have a significant impact on weather patterns. When winds converge, they force air to rise. This rising air cools and condenses, forming clouds and precipitation. Wind effects convergence can also lead to the development of strong winds, such as thunderstorms and tornadoes.\nGive some examples of wind convergence?\nHere are some specific examples of wind effects convergence:\nSea breeze convergence: During the day, the land heats up faster than the ocean. This causes the air over the land to rise, creating a low-pressure area. Winds then blow from the ocean towards the land to fill in the low-pressure area. This convergence of winds at the coastline can lead to the formation of clouds and precipitation showers. Mountain convergence: When winds blow up a mountain slope, they converge at the ridge. This convergence of winds can lead to the formation of clouds and precipitation on the windward side of the mountain. Frontal convergence: When a warm front and a cold front collide, they create a region of convergence where the warm air rises over the cold air. This convergence can lead to the formation of clouds and precipitation. Upper-level convergence: When winds in the upper levels of the atmosphere converge, it creates a region of low pressure at the surface. This convergence can lead to the formation of clouds and precipitation. Wind effects convergence is an important factor in weather forecasting.

The upper-level divergence helps to lift air, while the surface convergence helps to focus the lift. Tornadoes: Tornadoes can form in regions of strong upper-level divergence and surface convergence. The upper-level divergence helps to lift air, while the surface convergence helps to rotate the air. Hurricanes: Hurricanes form in regions of strong upper-level divergence and low-level convergence.

It is similar to gradient wind, but it does not take into account the Coriolis effect.\nCyclostrophic wind is most common in small-scale, short-lived weather systems, such as tornadoes, dust devils, and waterspouts. In these systems, the radius of curvature of the airflow is relatively small, and the Coriolis force has not had time to become significant.\nCyclostrophic wind can also be found near the equator, where the Coriolis force is weak.\nCyclostrophic wind is usually much faster than gradient wind because it does not have to balance the Coriolis effect. For example, the wind speeds in a tornado can reach hundreds of miles per hour.\nExample:\nConsider a tornado. The pressure gradient force will cause the wind to blow from the outside of the tornado towards the center. However, the centrifugal force will act on the wind because the wind is flowing in a circular path. The centrifugal force is directed away from the center of the tornado, so it will tend to push the wind outward.\nThe balance between the pressure gradient force and the centrifugal force will determine the direction and speed of the wind. This balance is called cyclostrophic balance.\nCyclostrophic wind will blow parallel to the isobars, but it will not be directly perpendicular to the pressure gradient force. The angle between the wind and the pressure gradient force will depend on the strength of the pressure gradient force and the centrifugal force.\nCyclostrophic wind is a powerful and dangerous force. It can cause significant damage to property and infrastructure.\n","divergence#Divergence":"Divergence What is wind effects divergence? Wind effects divergence refer to the effects of horizontal winds on the divergence of air. Divergence is a measure of how much air is spreading out from a given point. It is calculated as the sum of the changes in the wind speed in the x, y, and z directions. Wind effects divergence can be either positive or negative. Positive divergence means that air is spreading out from a given point, while negative divergence means that air is converging towards a given point.\nWhat are the examples of Wind effect divergence? Here are some examples of wind effects divergence:\nUpper-level divergence: When winds in the upper levels of the atmosphere spread out, it creates a region of low pressure at the surface. This can lead to the formation of clouds and precipitation. Surface convergence: When winds at the surface converge, it creates a region of high pressure. This can lead to clear skies and dry weather. Coastal convergence: When winds blow from the ocean towards the land, they converge at the coastline. This can lead to the formation of fog and clouds along the coast. Mountain convergence: When winds blow up a mountain slope, they converge at the ridge. This can lead to the formation of clouds and precipitation on the windward side of the mountain. What are the effects of wind divergence on weather pattern?\nWind effects divergence can have a significant impact on weather patterns. For example, upper-level divergence is often associated with the development of mid-latitude cyclones, while surface convergence is often associated with the development of anticyclones. Here are some specific examples of weather events that can be caused by wind effects divergence:\nThunderstorms: Thunderstorms often form in regions of upper-level divergence and surface convergence.

Air flows from areas of high pressure to areas of low pressure. The stronger the pressure gradient, the stronger the wind will be.\nCoriolis effect is an apparent force that acts on moving objects on a rotating frame of reference. On Earth, the Coriolis effect deflects moving objects to the right in the Northern Hemisphere and to the left in the Southern Hemisphere.\nCentrifugal force is a fictitious force that acts on objects moving in a circular path. It is directed away from the center of the circle.\nThe Coriolis effect and centrifugal force are both important factors in determining the direction and speed of wind.\nIn the absence of other forces, wind would flow directly from high pressure to low pressure. However, the Coriolis effect causes the wind to be deflected to the right in the Northern Hemisphere and to the left in the Southern Hemisphere. This deflection is strongest at the poles and weakest at the equator.\nThe centrifugal force acts on the wind because the wind is flowing in a curved path around the Earth. The centrifugal force is directed away from the center of the Earth, so it tends to push the wind outward.\n","geostrophic-and-gradient-wind#Geostrophic and Gradient wind":"Geostrophic and gradient winds are two types of atmospheric winds that are driven by a balance between different forces.\nGeostrophic wind is a theoretical wind that flows parallel to isobars (lines of equal pressure) in a balance between the pressure gradient force and the Coriolis effect. Geostrophic wind is most common in the upper atmosphere, where friction is low.\nGradient wind is a more realistic wind that flows parallel to isobars in a balance between the pressure gradient force, the Coriolis effect, and the centrifugal force. Centrifugal force is a fictitious force that acts on objects moving in a circular path. It is directed away from the center of the circle.\nThe main difference between geostrophic and gradient wind is that gradient wind takes into account the curvature of the isobars, while geostrophic wind does not. In reality, isobars are almost always curved, so gradient wind is a more realistic representation of the wind than geostrophic wind.\nExample:\nConsider a high pressure system in the Northern Hemisphere. The pressure gradient force will cause the wind to blow from the high pressure system towards the surrounding low pressure systems. However, the Coriolis effect will deflect the wind to the right. This will cause the wind to flow in a circular path around the high pressure system.\nThe centrifugal force will act on the wind because the wind is flowing in a circular path. The centrifugal force is directed away from the center of the high pressure system, so it will tend to push the wind outward.\nThe balance between the pressure gradient force, the Coriolis effect, and the centrifugal force will determine the direction and speed of the wind.

The angle between the wind and the pressure gradient force will depend on the strength of the Coriolis effect and the centrifugal force.\nThe Coriolis effect is strongest at the poles and weakest at the equator, so the angle between the wind and the pressure gradient force will be greatest at the poles and smallest at the equator.\nThe centrifugal force is proportional to the wind speed squared, so the angle between the wind and the pressure gradient force will also increase with wind speed.\nGradient wind is an important concept in meteorology because it helps us to understand the global circulation of the atmosphere and the formation of weather patterns.\n","give-examples-of-how-wind-is-affected-by--coriolis-and-centrifugal-effects-balance-motion#Give examples of how wind is affected by  Coriolis, and centrifugal effects balance motion":"Here are some examples of how wind is affected by Coriolis, and centrifugal effects balance motion:\nThe Coriolis effect is responsible for the direction of the prevailing winds, such as the trade winds and the westerlies.\nThe Coriolis effect also causes hurricanes and other cyclones to rotate in a counterclockwise direction in the Northern Hemisphere and clockwise direction in the Southern Hemisphere.\nThe centrifugal force helps to keep the wind flowing in a circular path around hurricanes and other cyclones.\nThe balance between wind effects, Coriolis, and centrifugal effects is a complex one, but it is essential for understanding the global circulation of the atmosphere and the formation of weather patterns.\n","how-the-jet-stream-affects-the-weather#How the jet stream affects the weather:":"The jet stream can affect the weather in a number of ways. For example, it can:\nSteer storms, such as hurricanes and tornadoes, around the globe. Influence the location of high- and low-pressure systems. Affect the temperature and precipitation patterns in different regions. For example, if the jet stream is further south than usual, it can bring warm, moist air from the tropics into the mid-latitudes. This can lead to heavy precipitation and thunderstorms.\nIf the jet stream is further north than usual, it can bring cold, dry air from the Arctic into the mid-latitudes. This can lead to cold snaps and snowstorms.\nThe jet stream is also affected by climate change. Climate change is causing the Earth\u0026rsquo;s atmosphere to warm. This is causing the jet stream to become weaker and more wavy. This can lead to more extreme weather events, such as heat waves, cold snaps, and droughts.\n","how-to-stay-safe-during-cyclostrophic-wind#How to stay safe during cyclostrophic wind:":"If you are in an area where cyclostrophic wind is possible, be aware of the signs and symptoms. These include a sudden drop in pressure, a loud roaring sound, and a rotating cloud.\nIf you see any of these signs, seek shelter immediately. The best shelter is a basement or interior room with no windows.\nIf you are caught outdoors, lie down in a ditch or other low-lying area and cover your head with your arms.\nStay tuned to local weather reports and follow the instructions of emergency personnel.","how-to-track-the-jet-stream#How to track the jet stream:":"The jet stream can be tracked using weather satellites and ground-based weather stations. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) provides daily updates on the jet stream\u0026rsquo;s location and strength.\nYou can track the jet stream yourself using a variety of online resources. For example, the National Weather Service website provides a number of jet stream maps and animations.\n","jet-stream#Jet Stream":"The jet stream is a narrow band of strong wind that flows from west to east high in the upper atmosphere. It is typically found between 6 and 12 miles (10 and 20 kilometers) above the surface of the Earth. The jet stream can reach speeds of up to 250 miles per hour (400 kilometers per hour).\nThe jet stream is caused by the temperature difference between the equator and the poles. The equator is warmer than the poles, so the air at the equator rises. As the air rises, it cools and flows towards the poles. When the air reaches the poles, it sinks and warms. This cycle of rising and sinking air creates the jet stream.\nThe jet stream is a very important feature of the Earth\u0026rsquo;s atmosphere. It helps to steer weather systems around the globe. The jet stream also helps to mix the air between the tropics and the poles, which helps to regulate the Earth\u0026rsquo;s temperature.\n","what-is-geostrophic-balance#What is Geostrophic Balance?":"The balance between the pressure gradient force, the Coriolis effect, and the centrifugal force determines the direction and speed of the wind.

In the lower atmosphere, friction plays a role in slowing down the wind and reducing the Coriolis effect.\n","wind-confluence#Wind Confluence":"What is wind confluence? Wind confluence is a pattern of wind flow in which air flows inward towards an axis that is oriented parallel to the general direction of flow. It is the opposite of diffluence. Wind confluence can be caused by a variety of factors, including:\nTopography: Mountains and valleys can channel wind, causing it to converge. Sea breezes: Sea breezes are caused by the differential heating between the land and the ocean during the day. The land heats up faster than the ocean, causing the air over the land to rise. This creates a region of low pressure over the land, and winds then blow from the ocean towards the land to fill in the low-pressure area. This convergence of winds at the coastline creates a sea breeze. Frontal systems: When a warm front and a cold front collide, they create a region of convergence where the warm air rises over the cold air. This convergence can lead to the development of clouds and precipitation. Upper-level troughs: Upper-level troughs are regions of low pressure in the upper levels of the atmosphere. As a trough passes over a region, it can create a region of confluence in the upper levels. This confluence can lead to the development of rising air, which can in turn lead to the formation of clouds and precipitation. What are the effects of wind confluence?\nWind confluence can have a significant impact on weather patterns. When winds converge, they force air to rise.

It is the opposite of confluence. Diffluence is often associated with upper-level troughs in the atmosphere. As a trough passes over a region, it creates a region of diffluence in the upper levels. This diffluence can lead to the development of rising air, which can in turn lead to the formation of clouds and precipitation. Diffluence can also be found in the lower levels of the atmosphere. For example, difluence can occur along the coastline on a hot summer day. As the land heats up, it creates a low-pressure area over the land. Winds then blow from the ocean towards the land to fill in the low-pressure area.

It is calculated as the curl of the wind velocity. Vorticity is a vector quantity, meaning that it has both magnitude and direction. The magnitude of vorticity represents the strength of the rotation, while the direction of vorticity represents the axis around which the rotation is occurring. Wind vorticity can be either positive or negative. Positive vorticity indicates that the wind is rotating counterclockwise, while negative vorticity indicates that the wind is rotating clockwise.\nExplain the effects of Wind Vorticity.\nWind vorticity is an important quantity in meteorology because it is associated with a number of different weather phenomena, including:\nThunderstorms: Thunderstorms often form in regions of high vorticity. The vorticity helps to lift the air and create the instability that is necessary for thunderstorm development. Tornadoes: Tornadoes are formed by intense vortices. The vorticity of a tornado can be extremely high, which is why tornadoes are so destructive. Hurricanes: Hurricanes are also characterized by high vorticity. The vorticity of a hurricane helps to organize the storm and keep it together. Wind vorticity can also influence the movement of weather systems. For example, a trough in the upper atmosphere is associated with a positive vorticity anomaly. This positive vorticity anomaly can help to steer the trough and the associated weather system.\nWind vorticity is a complex topic, but it is an important concept to understand in order to understand weather forecasting.

","development-of-satellite-meteorology#Development of Satellite Meteorology":"Development of Satellite Meteorology The historical development of satellite meteorology can be traced back to the early days of the space race between the United States and the Soviet Union. In 1957, the Soviet Union launched Sputnik 1, the first artificial satellite to orbit Earth. Sputnik 1 provided the first space views of our planet\u0026rsquo;s surface and atmosphere, and its success spurred the development of meteorological satellites.\nThe first weather satellite, Vanguard 2, was launched by the United States in 1959. Vanguard 2 was designed to measure cloud cover distribution over the daylight portion of its orbit and to provide information on the density of the atmosphere. However, Vanguard 2 failed to achieve orbit, and it was not until 1960 that the first successful weather satellite, TIROS-1, was launched.\nTIROS-1 was a polar-orbiting satellite that carried two television cameras. It provided the first global images of the Earth\u0026rsquo;s cloud cover, and it revolutionized the way that meteorologists monitored weather systems. TIROS-1 was followed by a series of increasingly sophisticated polar-orbiting weather satellites, including the Nimbus and NOAA series.\nIn 1966, the United States launched ATS-1, the first geostationary weather satellite. Geostationary satellites orbit the Earth at an altitude of approximately 22,236 miles, and they remain in a fixed position over a particular point on the Earth\u0026rsquo;s surface. This makes them ideal for monitoring weather systems and providing real-time images of the Earth\u0026rsquo;s cloud cover.\nToday, there are dozens of weather satellites in orbit around Earth, operated by a variety of nations and international organizations. These satellites provide meteorologists with a wealth of data about the Earth\u0026rsquo;s atmosphere, including cloud cover, temperature, moisture, and wind speed. This data is used to improve weather forecasts and to track severe weather events, such as hurricanes, tornadoes, and thunderstorms.\n","key-milestones-in-the-historical-development-of-satellite-meteorology#Key milestones in the historical development of satellite meteorology:":"1957: Launch of Sputnik 1, the first artificial satellite to orbit Earth.\n1959: Launch of Vanguard 2, the first weather satellite.\n1960: Launch of TIROS-1, the first successful weather satellite.\n1966: Launch of ATS-1, the first geostationary weather satellite.\n1970s: Development of the Nimbus and NOAA series of polar-orbiting weather satellites.\n1980s: Development of the GOES and Meteosat series of geostationary weather satellites.\n1990s: Development of new weather satellite sensors, such as microwave radiometers and infrared sounders.\n2000s: Launch of a new generation of weather satellites, such as the NPP and JPSS series in the United States and the FY-3 series in China."},"title":"History of Satellite Meteorology"},"/extra/docs/partc/em301/satmet/sattropic/":{"data":{"":" Satellite data is essential for tropical storm analysis.
