To sound, a hydrographic surveyor will lower a weighted line, called a sounding lead, to the bottom of the water and then measure the depth. Sounding is typically done from a small boat, but it can also be done from shore or from a helicopter.\nEcho sounding: Echo sounding is a more advanced technique that uses sound waves to measure the depth of water. An echo sounder emits a sound wave and then measures the time it takes for the wave to return to the surface. The depth of the water is then calculated based on the speed of sound in water. Echo sounding is more accurate than sounding and can be used to survey large areas of water quickly and efficiently.\nSide scan sonar: Side scan sonar is a type of sonar that uses sound waves to create images of the seafloor. A side scan sonar system emits sound waves to the sides of a survey vessel and then measures the returning echoes. The echoes are then used to create a two-dimensional image of the seafloor. Side scan sonar is useful for detecting underwater features, such as shipwrecks and pipelines.\nMultibeam sonar: Multibeam sonar is the most advanced type of sonar used in hydrographic surveying. It emits multiple sound beams in different directions to create a three-dimensional image of the seafloor. Multibeam sonar is the most accurate and efficient method of hydrographic surveying, but it is also the most expensive.\nIn addition to measuring depth, hydrographic surveys also collect information about the position of underwater features. This information is collected using a variety of positioning technologies, such as GPS, Differential Global Positioning System (DGPS), and Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS).\nOnce the depth and positioning data has been collected, it is processed using specialized software to create a nautical chart. Nautical charts show the depth of water, the position of underwater features, and other important information for navigation.\nHydrographic surveys are conducted in a variety of environments, including oceans, lakes, rivers, and harbors. The specific techniques used will vary depending on the environment and the purpose of the survey. For example, a hydrographic survey of a shallow river might use sounding and GPS to measure the depth and position of the riverbed. A hydrographic survey of a deep ocean might use multibeam sonar and GNSS to create a detailed three-dimensional image of the seafloor.\nHydrographic surveying is an essential part of safe navigation and maritime transportation. Hydrographic surveyors collect the data that is used to create nautical charts, which are essential for ships and boats to navigate safely. Hydrographic surveys are also used for a variety of other purposes, such as coastal engineering, environmental monitoring, and marine research.\n","here-are-some-examples-of-how-hydrographic-surveying-is-used-in-the-real-world#Here are some examples of how hydrographic surveying is used in the real world:":" Hydrographic surveys are used to create nautical charts for commercial and recreational shipping. Hydrographic surveys are used to map the seabed for coastal engineering projects, such as building new ports and harbors. Hydrographic surveys are used to monitor environmental changes, such as coastal erosion and sea level rise. Hydrographic surveys are used to support marine research, such as studying the distribution of marine life and mapping the location of hydrothermal vents. Hydrographic surveying is a vital field that plays a critical role in the safety and efficiency of maritime transportation.

The hydrographic survey team is responsible for creating a detailed map of the seabed in the port area. The survey team will use this map to design the port and to ensure that it is safe for ships to enter and leave.\nThe survey team begins by establishing a control network. They use GPS to survey a number of points on the coastline. These points will be used as references for all other survey measurements.\nOnce the control network is in place, the survey team begins to collect data on the seabed. They use a variety of hydrographic survey methods, including multibeam sonar and side scan sonar. These methods allow the survey team to create a detailed three-dimensional image of the seabed.\nThe survey team collects data on the depth of the water, the position of underwater features, and the composition of the seabed. This data is then processed using specialized software to create a nautical chart of the port area.\nThe nautical chart shows the depth of water, the position of underwater features, and other important information for navigation. The port authorities will use this chart to design the port and to ensure that it is safe for ships to enter and leave.\nThis case study demonstrates the importance of control in hydrographic surveying. Control is essential for ensuring that all survey measurements are accurate and reliable. This is especially important for high-stakes projects, such as the construction of a new port.\n","here-are-some-of-the-factors-that-hydrographic-surveyors-need-to-consider-when-planning-and-executing-a-survey#Here are some of the factors that hydrographic surveyors need to consider when planning and executing a survey:":" The size and complexity of the survey area. The required accuracy of the survey results. The availability of existing control points. The budget and time constraints of the survey. The specific hydrographic survey methods that will be used. Once the hydrographic surveyor has considered all of these factors, they can develop a plan for establishing a control network. The specific control techniques that are used will vary depending on the factors listed above.\nFor example, a hydrographic survey of a small harbor might use a simple control network of existing triangulation stations. A hydrographic survey of a large offshore area might require a more complex control network, including new GPS reference points, tide gauges, and photogrammetric methods.\nControl is an essential element of hydrographic surveying. It ensures that all survey measurements are referenced to a common coordinate system and that the survey results are accurate and reliable. Hydrographic surveyors carefully plan and execute their surveys to ensure that the control network is adequate for the specific needs of their project.\n","horizontal-control#Horizontal control":"","vertical-control#Vertical control":"Control in hydrographic surveying is the process of establishing a network of known horizontal and vertical positions that is used to reference all other survey measurements. Control is essential for ensuring the accuracy and reliability of hydrographic surveys.\nThere are two main types of control in hydrographic surveying: horizontal control and vertical control.\nHorizontal control establishes the horizontal position of survey points. It is typically established using a network of geodetic survey markers, such as triangulation stations and GPS reference points. Horizontal control can also be established using photogrammetric methods, such as aerial photography and satellite imagery.\nVertical control establishes the vertical position of survey points. It is typically established using a network of bench marks, which are fixed points with known elevations. Vertical control can also be established using tidal gauges and GPS measurements.\nOnce the horizontal and vertical control networks have been established, survey points can be referenced to the control network using a variety of positioning technologies, such as GPS, DGPS, and GNSS.\n** Control** is essential for hydrographic surveying because it ensures that all survey measurements are referenced to a common coordinate system. This is important for ensuring the accuracy and reliability of the survey results.\nIn addition to ensuring accuracy, control also provides a number of other benefits for hydrographic surveys. For example, control can be used to:\nReduce the amount of time and resources required to complete a survey. By using control, hydrographic surveyors can avoid having to resurvey areas that have already been surveyed. Improve the quality of survey data. Control can help to identify and correct errors in survey data. Integrate data from different sources. Control can be used to integrate data from different hydrographic surveys, as well as data from other sources, such as aerial photography and satellite imagery. Control networks for hydrographic surveys are typically designed and established by geodetic surveyors.

They provide mariners with information about the seafloor, surrounding land, and navigational hazards. Navigational charts are also used for a variety of other purposes, such as coastal engineering, marine research, and maritime planning.\nThe preparation of navigational charts is a complex process that involves the collection, processing, and analysis of a wide variety of data. The goal of chart preparation is to create a depiction of the seafloor and surrounding land that is accurate, reliable, and easy to use for navigation.\n1.The first step in preparing a navigational chart is to collect data on the seafloor and surrounding land. This data is collected using a variety of hydrographic survey methods, such as multibeam sonar, side scan sonar, and echo sounding. Hydrographic surveys also collect data on the position of underwater features, such as shipwrecks and pipelines.\nOnce the data has been collected, it is processed and analyzed using specialized software. This software is used to create a digital elevation model (DEM) of the seafloor. The DEM is a three-dimensional representation of the seafloor that shows its depth and relief.\nThe DEM is then used to create a contour map of the seafloor. The contour map shows the depth of the water at different locations. Contour maps are an important tool for navigation because they allow mariners to see the shape of the seabed and to identify underwater hazards.\nIn addition to the contour map, navigational charts also include a variety of other information, such as:\nThe position of navigational aids, such as lighthouses and buoys The location of restricted areas, such as shipping lanes and military zones The names of geographical features, such as islands and reefs Tides and currents Magnetic variation Meteorological information Navigational charts are typically prepared by government agencies, such as the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) in the United States. However, there are also a number of private companies that produce navigational charts.\nOnce the navigational chart has been created, it is published and made available to mariners. Navigational charts are available in a variety of formats, including paper charts, electronic charts, and online charts.\nNavigational charts are essential for safe and efficient navigation. They provide mariners with the information they need to avoid hazards and to navigate accurately. Navigational charts are also used for a variety of other purposes, such as coastal engineering, marine research, and maritime planning.\n","here-are-some-additional-details-about-the-theory-of-preparation-of-navigational-charts#Here are some additional details about the theory of preparation of navigational charts:":" Projection: Navigational charts use a variety of projections to represent the curved surface of the Earth on a flat plane. The most common projection used for navigational charts is the Mercator projection. The Mercator projection is a conformal projection, which means that it preserves the shape of objects on the chart. However, the Mercator projection distorts the size of objects, particularly near the poles. Datum: Navigational charts are referenced to a datum, which is a horizontal and vertical reference system. The most common datum used for navigational charts is the World Geodetic System 1984 (WGS 84). WGS 84 is a global datum that is used by GPS receivers. Symbology: Navigational charts use a variety of symbols to represent different features, such as navigational aids, underwater hazards, and geographical features. The symbols used on navigational charts are standardized so that mariners can easily understand them. The preparation of navigational charts is a complex and challenging task. However, it is an essential task for ensuring the safety of mariners and the efficient operation of maritime commerce."},"title":"Theory of preparation of Navigational Chart"},"/docs/partc/em301/hydrosurv/posfix/":{"data":{"":"","advantages#Advantages:":" Accurate: Short-range high accuracy radio signals can provide centimeter-level positioning accuracy.

This allows hydrographic surveyors to create accurate and detailed maps of the seabed. RTK GPS is used to position survey vessels and other survey equipment in real time. This is particularly useful for surveys of dynamic environments, such as tidal rivers and estuaries. For example, RTK GPS can be used to position a survey vessel while it is conducting a bathymetric survey of a tidal river. LPS is used to position survey vessels and other survey equipment in areas where GPS signals are not available or are unreliable. For example, LPS is often used to position survey vessels and other survey equipment in coastal areas and harbors, where GPS signals can be blocked by tall buildings and other structures. Short-range high accuracy radio signals offer a number of advantages for hydrographic survey position fixing. They are accurate, reliable, and relatively inexpensive. They can also be used in a variety of environments.\nHowever, it is important to note that short-range high accuracy radio signals have a limited range.

Based on the concept of prior informed consent, it requires that, before an export may take place, the authorities of the State of export notify the authorities of the prospective States of import and transit, providing them with detailed information on the intended movement.\nThe movement may only proceed if and when all States concerned have given their written consent (articles 6 and 7). The Basel Convention also provides for cooperation between parties, ranging from exchange of information on issues relevant to the implementation of the Convention to technical assistance, particularly to developing countries (articles 10 and 13). The Secretariat is required to facilitate and support this cooperation, acting as a clearing-house (article 16). In the event of a transboundary movement of hazardous wastes having been carried out illegally, i.e. in contravention of the provisions of articles 6 and 7, or cannot be completed as foreseen, the Convention attributes responsibility to one or more of the States involved, and imposes the duty to ensure safe disposal, either by re-import into the State of generation or otherwise (articles 8 and 9). The Convention also provides for the establishment of regional or sub-regional centres for training and technology transfers regarding the management of hazardous wastes and other wastes and the minimization of their generation to cater to the specific needs of different regions and subregions (article 14). Fourteen such centres have been established. They carry out training and capacity building activities in the regions. ","how-is-it-implemented#How is it implemented?":"What is it? The Basel Convention on the Control of Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes and their Disposal, 1989 is an international treaty that aims to protect human health and the environment against the adverse effects of hazardous wastes. It was adopted on 22 March 1989 and entered into force on 5 May 1992. As of October 1, 2023, it has 189 parties.\nThe Convention covers a wide range of wastes, including toxic, poisonous, explosive, corrosive, flammable, ecotoxic, and infectious wastes. It also covers two types of wastes defined as \u0026ldquo;other wastes\u0026rdquo; - household waste and incinerator ash.\nThe Convention regulates the transboundary movement of hazardous wastes and other wastes and obliges its parties to ensure that such wastes are managed and disposed of in an environmentally sound manner. Parties have an obligation to minimize the quantities that are transported, to treat and dispose of wastes as close as possible to their place of generation, and to prevent or minimize the generation of wastes at source.\nThe Convention also prohibits the export of hazardous wastes from developed countries to developing countries. This is known as the \u0026ldquo;ban amendment\u0026rdquo; and it was adopted in 1995.\nHow is it implemented? The Basel Convention is implemented through a system of prior informed consent (PIC), which requires parties to notify each other and obtain consent before shipping hazardous wastes and other wastes across borders. The Convention also establishes a number of other measures to control the transboundary movement of hazardous wastes, including a requirement for packaging, labeling, and transport in accordance with international standards.\nThe Basel Convention has played an important role in reducing the transboundary movement of hazardous wastes and protecting human health and the environment. However, there are still a number of challenges that need to be addressed, such as the illegal trafficking of hazardous wastes and the management of hazardous wastes in developing countries.\n","milestones#Milestones":" 1989 Adopted on 22 March\n1995 The Ban Amendment\n1998 Annexes 8 and 9 adopted\n1999 Basel protocol on Liability and Compensation, Committee for administering and implementation established 2002 interim guidelines for technical Cooperation\n2008 MPPI(Mobile phone partnership initiative), Action for partnership on Computing Equipment(PACE), The Bali Declaration on Waste Management for Human Health and Livelihood 2010 ExCOPs( extraordinary Conference of Parties) Bali\nSince its adoption, the Basel Convention has seen a number of significant developments.\nThe Amendment to the Convention on the Con­trol of Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes and their Disposal (“the Ban Amendment”) was adopted by the third meeting of the Conference of the Parties (COP) in 1995. The Ban Amendment provides for the prohibition of ex­ports of all hazardous wastes covered by the Convention that are intended for final disposal, reuse, recycling and recovery from countries listed in annex VII to the Convention (Parties and other States which are members of the OECD, EC, Liechtenstein) to all oth­er countries. As at 1 January 2011, the Ban Amendment has not yet entered into force. The challenge of protecting vulnerable countries from unwanted hazardous waste imports, while not precluding the import of wastes considered valuable secondary raw materials to countries in a position to manage them in an environmentally sound manner has therefore gained importance. Informal discussions were initiated at COP 9 in 2008 to identify a way to enable the entry into force of the Ban Amendment while addressing the concerns and needs of all countries in this context.\nAnnexes VIII and IX to the Convention, which provide further elaboration as to the wastes regulated by the Convention as listed in Annexes I and III were adopted by COP 4 in 1998.\nThe Basel Protocol on Liability and Compensation for Damage resulting from Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes and their Disposal was adopted by COP 5 in 1999. The Basel Protocol regulates civil liability for damage resulting from the transboundary movement of hazardous wastes and other wastes, including incidents occurring as a result of illegal traffic. As at 1 January 2011, the Basel Protocol has not yet entered into force. Delegates at COP 5 also agreed on an interim arrangement to cover emergency situations until the Protocol en­ters into force. COP 6 in 2002 approved the Interim Guidelines for the Implementa­tion of decision V/32 on the Enlargement of the scope of the Technical Cooperation Trust Fund.\nA Committee for Administering the Mechanism for Promoting Implementation and Compliance was established at COP 6 in Geneva in 2002. The objective of this mechanism is to assist parties to comply with their obligations under the Convention and to facilitate, promote, monitor and aim to secure the implementation of, and compliance with, the obligations under the Convention. The mechanism is non-confrontational, transparent, cost-effective and preventive in nature, simple, flexible, non-binding and oriented in the direction of helping parties to implement the provisions of the Basel Convention.\nOne of the most important contributions of the Basel Convention over the past 20 years is the elaboration of a significant number of policy instruments with non-binding character. Within the framework of the Convention, a large body of technical guidelines on the management of specific waste streams has been developed by technical government expert groups and approved by the COP. These non-binding instruments have been designed for the use of Governments at all levels, as well as other stakeholders, to provide practical guidance and thus facilitate the management of the relevant waste streams.\nIn 2002, COP 6 adopted the Strategic Plan for the implementation of the Basel Convention for the period 2002 to 2010, to assist developing countries and countries with economies in transition in implementing the provisions of the Convention. Numerous national and regional capacity building and training projects have since been implemented under the umbrella of the Strategic Plan, with the assistance of the Secretariat and the Basel Convention Regional Centres. COP 10 in October 2011 is expected to adopt a new strategic framework for the period 2011 to 2021, defining the fundamental aims and priorities of the Convention for the relevant decade while taking into account changes that have occurred since its adoption.\nCOP 6 also established a partnership programme with business and industry. Under this programme, two public-private partnerships have thus far been successfully launched, both with the objective of developing specific technical guidelines – to be used by the relevant industry and authorities for the management of end-of-life electronic devices and electronic waste – and initiating relevant pilot projects at country level, including in companies. Between 2003 and 2008, the Mobile Phone Partnership Initiative (MPPI) developed guidelines for every stage of the management of end-of-life mobile phones, which are being used in relevant facilities. 2008 saw the inception of the Partnership for Action on Computing Equipment (PACE) by COP 9. Building on experience gained with the MPPI, PACE is working to increase the environmentally sound management of used and end-of-life computing equipment.\nThe Bali Declaration on Waste Management for Human Health and Livelihood, adopted by COP 9 in 2008, has affirmed at the political level that waste, if not managed in a safe and environmentally sound manner, may have serious consequences for the environment, human health and sustainable livelihood. The commitment agreed by Ministers in the Bali Declaration to prevent the illegal transboundary movement of hazardous wastes, minimize the generation of hazardous wastes and promote the safe and environmentally sound management of waste within each country has since been supported by other international organizations. Following the UNEP Governing Council / Global Ministerial Environment Forum in 2009, the World Health Assembly in May 2010 and the Human Rights Council in June 2010 also highlighted the link between toxic waste, human health, and the enjoyment of human rights.\nRecently, the management of hazardous chemicals and wastes has moved up on the international political agenda in the context of environmental governance. This is in no small part due to what has become known as the “synergies” process between the Basel, Rotterdam Convention on the Prior Informed Consent Procedure for Certain Hazardous Chemicals and Pesticides in International Trade and the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants. Several years of deliberations through a Party-led process culminated in the successful simultaneous extraordinary meetings of the Conferences of the Parties to the Basel, Rotterdam and Stockholm conventions (ExCOPs) took place in Bali from 22 to 24 February 2010. A “first” in the history of international treaties and the highlight of the synergies process thus far, the ExCOPs gave directions for countries to implement the three conventions in a more holistic and coordinated way. The conventions have joined forces to better address the challenge of environmentally sound management of hazardous substances at different stages of their life cycle.\nThe Basel Convention celebrated its 20th anniversary in 2009 – an event commemorated in November 2009 in Basel (Switzerland). On this occasion, Kenya, Indonesia, and Colombia, the past, present and future Presidents of the COP, together with Switzerland as the host of the Diplomatic Conference in 1989, launched the Basel Waste Solutions Circle, an initiative showcasing projects at all levels that contribute in a concrete manner to the implementation of the Bali Declaration.\nOver the past 20 years, the Basel Convention has had ample occasion to adjust to new global developments and needs with regards to waste management over the years, and has risen to these challenges. With the added benefit of closer cooperation with the Rotterdam and Stockholm conventions, the Convention now has the potential to start considering wastes more in a life cycle context. This will make it possible to embrace new ways of thinking.\nThe Basel Convention plays a decisive role in achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) - poverty reduction, reducing child mortality, improving maternal health, ensure environmental sustainability. Waste minimization undoubtedly leads us to achieving the MDGs. In addition, state-of-the art recycling in accordance with agreed standards could create business opportunities and safe jobs; a higher yield of secondary raw materials; conservation of precious resources through extraction and re-use rather than primary mining; and better protection of the air, soil, water and thus human health. Realizing this potential might also lessen the incentives for illegal recycling operations, through providing legal, safe and economically rewarding alternatives.\n","objective#Objective":"The overarching objective of the Basel Convention is to protect human health and the environment against the adverse effects of hazardous wastes. Its scope of application covers a wide range of wastes defined as “hazardous wastes” based on their origin and/or composition and their characteristics, as well as two types of wastes defined as “other wastes” - household waste and incinerator ash.","overview#Overview":"The Basel Convention on the Control of Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes and their Disposal was adopted on 22 March 1989 by the Conference of Plenipotentiaries in Basel, Switzerland, in response to a public outcry following the discovery, in the 1980s, in Africa and other parts of the developing world of deposits of toxic wastes imported from abroad.\nAwakening environmental awareness and corresponding tightening of environmental regulations in the industrialized world in the 1970s and 1980s had led to increasing public resistance to the disposal of hazardous wastes – in accordance with what became known as the NIMBY (Not In My Back Yard) syndrome – and to an escalation of disposal costs. This in turn led some operators to seek cheap disposal options for hazardous wastes in Eastern Europe and the developing world, where environmental awareness was much less developed and regulations and enforcement mechanisms were lacking. It was against this background that the Basel Convention was negotiated in the late 1980s, and its thrust at the time of its adoption was to combat the “toxic trade”, as it was termed. The Convention entered into force in 1992.\n","what-are-the-key-achievements#What are the key achievements?":"Here are some of the key achievements of the Basel Convention:\nThe ban on the export of hazardous wastes from developed countries to developing countries has helped to protect developing countries from the dumping of hazardous wastes. The PIC system has helped to ensure that parties are aware of and have a say in the transboundary movement of hazardous wastes. The Convention has promoted the development of environmentally sound waste management practices in developing countries. The Basel Convention is an important tool for protecting human health and the environment from the adverse effects of hazardous wastes. It is essential that all parties continue to work together to implement the Convention effectively.

It commits developed countries to reduce their emissions by an average of 5.2% below 1990 levels by the first commitment period, 2008-2012.\nThe Kyoto Protocol includes a number of mechanisms to help countries achieve their emissions targets, including:\nEmissions trading: Countries can trade emissions permits with each other, so that countries that can reduce their emissions more cheaply can sell permits to countries that find it more difficult or expensive to reduce their emissions. Joint implementation: Countries can work together to implement projects that reduce emissions in other countries. Clean development mechanism: Developed countries can invest in projects that reduce emissions in developing countries, and then count the emissions reductions towards their own targets. The Kyoto Protocol has played an important role in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and promoting international cooperation on climate change. However, it has also been criticized for not being ambitious enough and for not including all major emitters, such as the United States. Here are some of the key achievements of the Kyoto Protocol:\nThe Kyoto Protocol has helped to raise awareness of the importance of reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

They are characterized by a central region of low atmospheric pressure and strong winds that rotate in a counterclockwise direction in the Northern Hemisphere and clockwise direction in the Southern Hemisphere.\nHow is a cyclonic storm formed?\nThe formation of cyclonic storms is a complex process that requires a number of factors to come together, including:\nWarm ocean waters: Cyclonic storms need warm ocean waters (at least 26°C or 79°F) to form and develop. The warm water provides the energy that drives the storm. Low wind shear: Cyclonic storms also need low wind shear, which is the change in wind direction and speed with altitude. High wind shear can disrupt the storm\u0026rsquo;s circulation and prevent it from developing. Atmospheric instability: Cyclonic storms also need atmospheric instability, which is a condition in which the atmosphere is prone to rising air. Rising air can cool and condense, forming clouds and rain. Once these conditions are met, a cyclonic storm can begin to form. The process typically starts with a small disturbance in the atmosphere, such as a wave on a weather front. As the disturbance grows, it begins to draw in warm, moist air from the surrounding ocean. This air rises and cools, forming clouds and rain. The rising air also releases latent heat, which further energizes the storm.\nAs the storm continues to grow, it develops a central region of low atmospheric pressure. This low pressure draws in even more air, which causes the winds to strengthen. The storm also develops a characteristic eye, which is a region of calm, clear air in the center of the storm.\nCyclonic storms can reach wind speeds of over 250 kilometers per hour (155 miles per hour). They can also produce heavy rains and storm surges that can cause significant damage.\n","forecasting-of-tropical-cyclones-has-improved-greatly-in-recent-years#Forecasting of tropical cyclones has improved greatly in recent years.":"There are certain areas over the oceans that are particularly favourable for tropical cyclone development, but it is usually certain characteristics in a cluster of thunderclouds that leads forecasters to recognise them as tropical depressions. This is done by people at specialist tropical cyclone forecasting centres around the globe such as the National Hurricane Center in Miami, Florida who are constantly studying satellite images, instruments and other weather data to detect and track them through their life-cycle. Once detected, their track is forecast using a combination of numerical forecasting models, synoptic forecasting and statistical methods, which have been developed from the study of the behaviour of past storms.\nObservations from ships at sea are always very useful, although, once the existence of a storm and its forecast track have been broadcast, ships tend to move out of their way! Reinforced aircraft, fitted with instruments, fly through and over tropical cyclones, and weather radar can locate storms within 200 miles of the radar station. In addition, tropical cyclones are tracked by satellites, which provide very useful information both to forecasters and numerical forecast models.\n\u0026ldquo;Official\u0026rdquo; responsibility for forecasting tropical cyclones in the areas affected lies with the regional centres such as the National Hurricane Center in Miami. However, the Met Office does produce tropical cyclone forecasts from its global model, which are disseminated to the regional centres. They then use these forecasts, along with other forms of guidance, to produce their forecasts. Met Office forecasts of tropical cyclones show considerable skill and are among the best models available to agencies such as the National Hurricane Center.\n","here-are-the-stages-of-cyclone-formation#Here are the stages of cyclone formation:":" Incipient disturbance: This is the early stage of development, when a small disturbance in the atmosphere begins to form. Tropical depression: The disturbance develops into a tropical depression when the winds reach speeds of at least 35 kilometers per hour (22 miles per hour). Tropical storm: The tropical depression becomes a tropical storm when the winds reach speeds of at least 65 kilometers per hour (40 miles per hour). Hurricane: The tropical storm becomes a hurricane when the winds reach speeds of at least 119 kilometers per hour (74 miles per hour). Cyclonic storms can continue to intensify after they reach hurricane strength. The strongest hurricanes can have wind speeds of over 300 kilometers per hour (186 miles per hour).\nCyclonic storms are a major natural hazard, and they can cause significant damage to life and property. It is important to be aware of the risks posed by cyclones and to have a plan in place if a cyclone is approaching your area.\n","measuring-tropical-cyclones#Measuring tropical cyclones":"In order to categorise tropical cyclones around the world, the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale is used defining events by their wind speed and impacts.\nAlthough developed in the USA, tropical cyclones around the world are measured by the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale which originated from 1971 with Herbert Saffir, a civil engineer and Bob Simpson of the US National Hurricane Center.\nThe Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale consists of a five point scale of hurricane intensity and starts at 74 mph. Tropical cyclones with wind speeds up to 38 mph are classified as tropical depressions and those with wind speeds from 39 - 73 mph are classified as tropical storms.\nIt is important to note that whilst the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale defines wind strengths and their likely impacts, severe impacts from tropical cyclones can also occur due to storm surge and heavy rain which are not necessarily directly related to the strength of the wind in the tropical cyclone.\nSaffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale Category 1 Wind (mph): 74 - 95\nDamage: Minimal - No significant structural damage, can uproot trees and cause some flooding in coastal areas.\nCategory 2 Wind (mph): 96 - 110\nModerate - No major destruction to buildings, can uproot trees and signs. Coastal flooding can occur. Secondary effects can include the shortage of water and electricity.\nCategory 3 Wind (mph): 111 - 129\nExtensive - Structural damage to small buildings and serious coastal flooding to those on low lying land. Evacuation may be needed.\nCategory 4 Wind (mph): 130-156\nExtreme - All signs and trees blown down with extensive damage to roofs. Flat land inland may become flooded. Evacuation probable.\nCategory 5 Wind (mph): greater than 156\nCatastrophic - Buildings destroyed with small buildings being overturned. All trees and signs blown down. Evacuation of up to 10 miles inland\n","rapid-intensification-of-cyclonic-storm#Rapid intensification of Cyclonic storm":"What is rapid intensification of a cyclonic storm?\nCyclonic storms can intensify rapidly, increasing in wind speed and size in a short period of time. This process is known as rapid intensification. The United States National Hurricane Center defines rapid intensification as an increase in the maximum sustained winds of a tropical cyclone of at least 30 knots (35 mph; 55 km/h) in a 24-hour period.\nThere are a number of factors that can contribute to the intensification of a cyclonic storm, including:\nWarm ocean waters: Cyclonic storms need warm ocean waters to intensify. The warm water provides the energy that drives the storm. Low wind shear: Cyclonic storms also need low wind shear to intensify. High wind shear can disrupt the storm\u0026rsquo;s circulation and prevent it from developing. Atmospheric instability: Cyclonic storms also need atmospheric instability to intensify. This is a condition in which the atmosphere is prone to rising air. Rising air can cool and condense, forming clouds and rain. Other factors that can contribute to rapid intensification include:\nThe presence of a mesoscale convective vortex (MCV): An MCV is a small rotating area of thunderstorms within a tropical cyclone. MCVs can help to enhance the cyclone\u0026rsquo;s circulation and lead to rapid intensification. The presence of a brown ocean vortex (BOV): A BOV is a swirling mass of warm water that can form beneath a tropical cyclone. BOVs can provide additional energy to the cyclone, helping it to intensify more quickly. Rapid intensification can be a dangerous process, as it can make it difficult for forecasters to predict the storm\u0026rsquo;s track and intensity. It can also lead to unexpected and severe impacts on coastal communities. In recent years, there has been a trend towards more rapid intensification of tropical cyclones. This is thought to be due to a combination of factors, including climate change, which is leading to warmer ocean waters, and natural variability.\nScientists are working to better understand the factors that contribute to rapid intensification and to develop improved forecasting methods. This will help to reduce the risk of loss of life and property from tropical cyclones.\n"},"title":"Cyclonic Storms"},"/docs/partc/em301/meteorology/el-nino/":{"data":{"":"","can-volcanic-eruptions-cause-el-niño-maybe-maybe-not#Can volcanic eruptions cause El Niño?

El Niño and La Niña are opposite extremes of the ENSO, which refers to cyclical environmental conditions that occur across the Equatorial Pacific Ocean. These changes are due to natural interactions between the ocean and atmosphere. Sea surface temperature, rainfall, air pressure, atmospheric and ocean circulation all influence each other.

(Image credit: NOAA)\n!(PHOTO El Nino.png)\nWhat is El Niño? What is La Niña? An El Niño condition occurs when surface water in the equatorial Pacific becomes warmer than average and east winds blow weaker than normal. The opposite condition is called La Niña. During this phase of ENSO, the water is cooler than normal and the east winds are stronger. El Niños typically occur every 3 to 5 years.\nENSO-Neutral or average conditions across the tropical Pacific Ocean. Climate.gov schematic by Emily Eng and inspired by NOAA PMEL. The rise of El Niño and La Niña How do El Niño and La Niña events form and increase in strength? The key is in the ocean-atmosphere coupling across the tropical Pacific Ocean.\nHow ENSO impacts humans? El Niño, La Niña, and the neutral condition all produce important consequences for people and ecosystems across the globe. The interactions between the ocean and atmosphere alters weather around the world and can result in severe storms or mild weather, drought or flooding. Beyond “just” influencing the weather, these changes can produce secondary results that influence food supplies and prices, forest fires, and create additional economic and political consequences. Famines and political strife can result from these environmental conditions.\n(top) The sea surface temperature (shaded contours), 10-meter wind (vectors), and (bottom) rainfall departures from average in June – August during an average Atlantic Niño. The gray dots in the bottom panel indicate that the rainfall departures are statistically significant (5% significance level), indicating a high degree of confidence that the rainfall departures are associated with Atlantic Niño. Climate.gov figure adapted from Vallès‐Casanova et al. (2020). Do you know that El Niño has a little brother? His name is Atlantic Niño, and he has an uncanny resemblance to his big brother: Like El Niño, Atlantic Niño is characterized by warmer-than-average sea surface temperatures in the eastern equatorial basin and weaker-than-average trade winds throughout the east-central equatorial Atlantic. What are some of ENSO\u0026rsquo;s impacts? Ecosystems and human communities can be positively or negatively affected. For example, in the Southern United States, during the fall through spring, El Niño usually causes increased rainfall and sometimes destructive flooding. La Niña, however, usually causes drier weather in the South, but the Northwest tends to be colder and wetter than average. Even though El Niño occurs in the Pacific Ocean, it often reduces the number of hurricanes that form in the Atlantic Ocean. Conversely, La Niña events tend to be related to an increase in the number of Atlantic hurricanes.\nFood production is impacted by ENSO. Changes in ocean temperatures and currents that happen during El Niño impact marine life. This can impact individuals who make a living fishing and consumers who depend on certain fish for food. Agriculture is of course very dependent on climate and weather, as a result ENSO’s influence on rainfall and temperature have important consequences for food production and availability.\nRedoubt Volcano viewed from the northwest following the April 4, 2009 eruption. Credit: R. G. McGimsey, USGS.\nCan volcanic eruptions cause El Niño? Maybe, maybe not Volcanic eruptions have had HUGE impacts on the global climate by cooling Earth. It’s only natural to wonder, if the planet is affected by volcanic eruptions, can ENSO be? The origin of the name The origin of the name “El Niño” dates to the 1800’s, when fishermen on the Pacific coast of South America would notice that a warm ocean current would appear every few years. Fish catches would drop drastically, negatively affecting the food supply and livelihood of the communities of coastal Peru. This warm water would arrive around Christmastime. Referring to the birth of Christ, they named the warm ocean waters, El Niño, which means “the boy” in Spanish. Fishing in this region is best during La Niña years when cold upwelling ocean water brings rich nutrientsoffsite link from the deep ocean, resulting in an increase in the number of fish caught.\nThe Southern Oscillation is a coherent interannual fluctuation of atmospheric pressure over the tropical Indo-Pacific region\nIt is the atmospheric component of a single large-scale coupled interaction called the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) The Southern Oscillation describes changes in air pressure patterns in the Southern Pacific Ocean between Tahiti, in the middle of the southern Pacific Ocean, and Darwin, Australia, to the west 2. Normally, lower pressure over Darwin and higher pressure over Tahiti encourages air movement from east to west 2. The Southern Oscillation Index (SOI) tracks the atmospheric part of the ENSO pattern 3.

A stable atmosphere is one in which vertical motion is suppressed, while an unstable atmosphere is one in which vertical motion is enhanced.\nWhat does Meteorological Stability depend upon?\nThe stability of the atmosphere is determined by a number of factors, including:\nTemperature: The temperature of the air decreases with altitude. If the air temperature decreases more slowly than the environmental temperature, the air parcel will be warmer than the surrounding air and will rise. This is known as instability. If the air temperature decreases more quickly than the environmental temperature, the air parcel will be cooler than the surrounding air and will sink. This is known as stability. Moisture: Water vapor is less dense than dry air. This means that a rising air parcel that is saturated with water vapor will be less dense than the surrounding air and will continue to rise. This is known as conditional instability. Wind shear: Wind shear is the change in wind speed or direction with altitude. Wind shear can destabilize the atmosphere by creating turbulence. Why is Meteorological stability Important?\nMeteorological stability is important for a number of reasons.\nFirst, it affects the development of clouds and precipitation. Stable atmospheres are less likely to produce clouds and precipitation, while unstable atmospheres are more likely to produce clouds and precipitation.\nSecond, meteorological stability affects the severity of weather events. For example, thunderstorms are more likely to develop in unstable atmospheres.\nThird, meteorological stability affects the transport of pollutants. Stable atmospheres can trap pollutants near the ground, while unstable atmospheres can transport pollutants higher into the atmosphere.\nWhat are the tools used by Meterologists to assess meteorological stability?\nMeteorologists use a variety of tools to assess meteorological stability, including:\nTemperature and dew point soundings: Temperature and dew point soundings are used to measure the temperature and moisture of the air at different altitudes. This information can be used to calculate the environmental lapse rate and the moist adiabatic lapse rate, which can then be used to assess stability. Wind shear profiles: Wind shear profiles are used to measure the change in wind speed or direction with altitude. This information can be used to assess the destabilizing effect of wind shear. Satellite imagery: Satellite imagery can be used to identify cloud patterns and other features that can be indicative of stability or instability.

NWP models use the laws of physics to simulate the atmosphere and oceans and to predict how they will change over time.\nNWP models are typically run on supercomputers, which are required to perform the billions of calculations necessary to produce a forecast. NWP models are initialized with current weather observations, which are collected from a variety of sources, including weather stations, aircraft, and satellites.\nOnce the model is initialized, it is run forward in time to produce a forecast. The forecast includes a variety of weather elements, such as temperature, precipitation, wind, and cloud cover.\nNWP models are constantly being improved as scientists learn more about the atmosphere and oceans. NWP models are now able to produce accurate forecasts for a variety of weather events, including thunderstorms, hurricanes, and winter storms.\nWhat are the uses of NWP? NWP forecasts are used by a variety of people and organizations, including:\nMeteorologists: Meteorologists use NWP forecasts to create weather forecasts for the public. Aviation: Pilots and other aviation professionals use NWP forecasts to plan flights. Shipping: Ship captains and other maritime professionals use NWP forecasts to plan voyages. Agriculture: Farmers and other agricultural professionals use NWP forecasts to make decisions about planting, harvesting, and irrigation. Energy: Energy companies use NWP forecasts to predict demand and to plan operations. NWP is a powerful tool for forecasting the weather and for making informed decisions about a variety of activities. NWP models are constantly being improved and are becoming more accurate all the time. What are some of the challenges of NWP?\nThe atmosphere is a complex system. There are a large number of factors that can influence the weather, and it is difficult to model all of these factors perfectly. Weather observations are not perfect. Weather observations are collected from a variety of sources, and the quality of these observations can vary. This can lead to errors in the model\u0026rsquo;s initial conditions. Computers have limited power. Even supercomputers are not powerful enough to simulate the atmosphere and oceans perfectly. This means that NWP models have to make approximations, which can lead to errors in the forecast. Despite these challenges, NWP is a very useful tool for forecasting the weather. NWP forecasts are used by a variety of people and organizations to make informed decisions about a variety of activities.\n","streamline-and-isotach-analysis#Streamline and isotach analysis":" ℹ️ What is Streamline and isotach analysis?\nStreamline and isotach analysis is a method of representing the wind field at a given level in the atmosphere. Streamlines are lines that are tangent to the wind at every point. Isotachs are lines of equal wind speed.\nWhat is Streamline and isotach analysis used for?\nStreamline and isotach analysis is useful for identifying a variety of weather features, including:\nFronts: Fronts are boundaries between air masses with different temperature and moisture characteristics. Streamline and isotach analysis can be used to identify the location of fronts and to determine the direction in which they are moving.\nCyclones and anticyclones: Cyclones and anticyclones are large-scale areas of low and high pressure, respectively. Streamline and isotach analysis can be used to identify the location of cyclones and anticyclones and to determine their strength and direction of movement.\nJet streams: Jet streams are narrow bands of strong wind that occur high in the atmosphere. Streamline and isotach analysis can be used to identify the location of jet streams and to determine their strength and direction of movement.\nStreamline and isotach analysis is also useful for forecasting weather. For example, meteorologists can use streamline and isotach analysis to predict where and when precipitation is likely to occur.\nHow is Streamline and isotach analysis done?\nTo create a streamline and isotach analysis, meteorologists use wind observations from weather stations and aircraft. They first plot the wind observations on a map. Then, they draw streamlines and isotachs connecting the wind observations.\nStreamlines are typically drawn at regular intervals, such as every 5 or 10 degrees. Isotachs are typically drawn at intervals of 5 or 10 knots.\nOnce the streamlines and isotachs have been drawn, meteorologists can begin to analyze the wind field. For example, they can look for areas where the streamlines are converging or diverging. Convergence of streamlines indicates an area where air is accumulating, which can lead to precipitation. Divergence of streamlines indicates an area where air is spreading out, which can lead to clear skies.\nMeteorologists can also look for areas where the isotachs are close together. This indicates an area where the wind is strong. Areas where the isotachs are far apart indicate an area where the wind is weak.\nStreamline and isotach analysis is a powerful tool for understanding and forecasting the weather. It is used by meteorologists around the world to create weather maps and forecasts.\n","synoptic-representation-of-pressure-field-contour-and-thickness-charts#Synoptic representation of pressure field, contour and thickness charts":"What are Synoptic Charts? Synoptic representation of pressure field, contour and thickness charts are a way to represent the current state of the atmosphere on a map.\nℹ️ Pressure field chart: A pressure field chart shows the distribution of atmospheric pressure at a given time. Pressure field charts are typically used to identify and track weather systems, such as fronts, cyclones, and anticyclones.\nContour chart: A contour chart shows the height of a given pressure surface above sea level. Contour charts are typically used to identify and track upper-level weather systems, such as jet streams and troughs.\nThickness chart: A thickness chart shows the difference in height between two pressure surfaces. Thickness charts are typically used to identify and track areas of warm and cold air, which can lead to precipitation and other weather events.\nWhat are synoptic charts used for? Synoptic charts are used by meteorologists to create weather forecasts and to study the atmosphere. They are also used by pilots and other aviation professionals to plan flights.\nℹ️ How to interpret synoptic charts?\nHere is a brief description of how to interpret synoptic charts:\nPressure field chart: The higher the pressure, the closer the air molecules are together and the heavier the air is. This makes high-pressure areas more stable and less likely to produce precipitation. Low-pressure areas are the opposite, with lower pressure and less stable air. Low-pressure areas are more likely to produce precipitation and other weather events, such as thunderstorms and tornadoes.\nContour chart: The closer the contour lines are together, the steeper the slope of the pressure surface. This means that the wind will be stronger in areas where the contour lines are closer together.\nThickness chart: Areas of warm air have a higher thickness than areas of cold air. This is because warm air expands and takes up more space than cold air. Thickness charts can be used to identify areas where there is a strong temperature gradient, which can lead to precipitation and other weather events.\nSynoptic charts can be complex and difficult to interpret, but they are a valuable tool for meteorologists and other professionals who need to understand the current state of the atmosphere.\n","synoptic-weather-observations#Synoptic weather observations":"Synoptic weather observations are observations of the atmosphere that are made at regular intervals, typically every three or six hours, at a global network of weather stations. These observations are used by meteorologists to create weather maps and forecasts.\nSynoptic weather observations typically include the following elements:\nTemperature: The air temperature at the time of the observation. Dew point: The temperature at which the air would become saturated with water vapor and condensation would occur. Wind speed and direction: The speed and direction of the wind at the time of the observation. Atmospheric pressure: The pressure of the atmosphere at the time of the observation. Cloud cover: The amount and type of cloud cover present at the time of the observation. Visibility: The horizontal distance at which objects can be clearly seen at the time of the observation. Precipitation: The type and amount of precipitation that has fallen since the previous observation. In addition to these basic elements, synoptic weather observations may also include other information, such as the presence of fog, thunderstorms, or other weather phenomena.\nImportance of Synoptic Weather Observation Systems\nSynoptic weather observations are important for a number of reasons. First, they provide meteorologists with a snapshot of the current state of the atmosphere. This information is used to create weather maps and forecasts, which help people to plan their daily activities and make informed decisions about their safety.\nSecond, synoptic weather observations can be used to track the movement of weather systems, such as fronts, cyclones, and anticyclones. This information can be used to predict where and when these weather systems will bring precipitation, thunderstorms, and other hazardous weather conditions.\nThird, synoptic weather observations are used to study the climate. By comparing weather observations from different time periods, scientists can identify trends in temperature, precipitation, and other weather elements. This information can be used to understand how the climate is changing and to predict how it will change in the future.\nSynoptic weather observations are collected by a variety of sources, including:\nStaffed weather stations: Staffed weather stations are operated by trained meteorologists who make manual observations of the atmosphere. Automated weather stations: Automated weather stations use sensors to collect weather data without human intervention. Aircraft: Aircraft also collect weather data, which is used to supplement the data collected from surface-based weather stations. Ships: Ships also collect weather data, which is used to provide information about the weather over the oceans. Synoptic weather observations are transmitted to weather forecasting centers around the world, where they are used to create weather maps and forecasts. These forecasts are then disseminated to the public through a variety of channels, such as television, radio, and the internet.\n"},"title":"Meteorological Observation Systems"},"/docs/partc/em301/meteorology/wind_effects/":{"data":{"":"","convergence#Convergence":"What is wind convergence? Wind effects convergence refer to the effects of horizontal winds on the convergence of air. Convergence is a measure of how much air is flowing towards a given point. It is calculated as the sum of the changes in the wind speed in the x, y, and z directions. Wind effects convergence can have a significant impact on weather patterns. When winds converge, they force air to rise. This rising air cools and condenses, forming clouds and precipitation. Wind effects convergence can also lead to the development of strong winds, such as thunderstorms and tornadoes.\nGive some examples of wind convergence?\nHere are some specific examples of wind effects convergence:\nSea breeze convergence: During the day, the land heats up faster than the ocean. This causes the air over the land to rise, creating a low-pressure area. Winds then blow from the ocean towards the land to fill in the low-pressure area. This convergence of winds at the coastline can lead to the formation of clouds and precipitation showers. Mountain convergence: When winds blow up a mountain slope, they converge at the ridge. This convergence of winds can lead to the formation of clouds and precipitation on the windward side of the mountain. Frontal convergence: When a warm front and a cold front collide, they create a region of convergence where the warm air rises over the cold air. This convergence can lead to the formation of clouds and precipitation. Upper-level convergence: When winds in the upper levels of the atmosphere converge, it creates a region of low pressure at the surface. This convergence can lead to the formation of clouds and precipitation. Wind effects convergence is an important factor in weather forecasting. By understanding how wind effects convergence can lead to the development of different weather events, meteorologists can better predict when and where these events will occur.\nWhat are the effects of wind convergence on weather pattern?\nHere are some specific examples of weather events that can be caused by wind effects convergence:\nThunderstorms: Thunderstorms often form in regions of upper-level divergence and surface convergence. The upper-level divergence helps to lift air, while the surface convergence helps to focus the lift. Tornadoes: Tornadoes can form in regions of strong upper-level divergence and surface convergence. The upper-level divergence helps to lift air, while the surface convergence helps to rotate the air. Hurricanes: Hurricanes form in regions of strong upper-level divergence and low-level convergence.

It is similar to gradient wind, but it does not take into account the Coriolis effect.\nCyclostrophic wind is most common in small-scale, short-lived weather systems, such as tornadoes, dust devils, and waterspouts. In these systems, the radius of curvature of the airflow is relatively small, and the Coriolis force has not had time to become significant.\nCyclostrophic wind can also be found near the equator, where the Coriolis force is weak.\nCyclostrophic wind is usually much faster than gradient wind because it does not have to balance the Coriolis effect. For example, the wind speeds in a tornado can reach hundreds of miles per hour.\nExample:\nConsider a tornado. The pressure gradient force will cause the wind to blow from the outside of the tornado towards the center. However, the centrifugal force will act on the wind because the wind is flowing in a circular path. The centrifugal force is directed away from the center of the tornado, so it will tend to push the wind outward.\nThe balance between the pressure gradient force and the centrifugal force will determine the direction and speed of the wind. This balance is called cyclostrophic balance.\nCyclostrophic wind will blow parallel to the isobars, but it will not be directly perpendicular to the pressure gradient force. The angle between the wind and the pressure gradient force will depend on the strength of the pressure gradient force and the centrifugal force.\nCyclostrophic wind is a powerful and dangerous force. It can cause significant damage to property and infrastructure.\n","divergence#Divergence":"Divergence What is wind effects divergence? Wind effects divergence refer to the effects of horizontal winds on the divergence of air. Divergence is a measure of how much air is spreading out from a given point. It is calculated as the sum of the changes in the wind speed in the x, y, and z directions. Wind effects divergence can be either positive or negative. Positive divergence means that air is spreading out from a given point, while negative divergence means that air is converging towards a given point.\nWhat are the examples of Wind effect divergence? Here are some examples of wind effects divergence:\nUpper-level divergence: When winds in the upper levels of the atmosphere spread out, it creates a region of low pressure at the surface. This can lead to the formation of clouds and precipitation. Surface convergence: When winds at the surface converge, it creates a region of high pressure. This can lead to clear skies and dry weather. Coastal convergence: When winds blow from the ocean towards the land, they converge at the coastline. This can lead to the formation of fog and clouds along the coast. Mountain convergence: When winds blow up a mountain slope, they converge at the ridge. This can lead to the formation of clouds and precipitation on the windward side of the mountain. What are the effects of wind divergence on weather pattern?\nWind effects divergence can have a significant impact on weather patterns. For example, upper-level divergence is often associated with the development of mid-latitude cyclones, while surface convergence is often associated with the development of anticyclones. Here are some specific examples of weather events that can be caused by wind effects divergence:\nThunderstorms: Thunderstorms often form in regions of upper-level divergence and surface convergence. The upper-level divergence helps to lift air, while the surface convergence helps to focus the lift. Tornadoes: Tornadoes can form in regions of strong upper-level divergence and surface convergence.

Air flows from areas of high pressure to areas of low pressure. The stronger the pressure gradient, the stronger the wind will be.\nCoriolis effect is an apparent force that acts on moving objects on a rotating frame of reference. On Earth, the Coriolis effect deflects moving objects to the right in the Northern Hemisphere and to the left in the Southern Hemisphere.\nCentrifugal force is a fictitious force that acts on objects moving in a circular path. It is directed away from the center of the circle.\nThe Coriolis effect and centrifugal force are both important factors in determining the direction and speed of wind.\nIn the absence of other forces, wind would flow directly from high pressure to low pressure. However, the Coriolis effect causes the wind to be deflected to the right in the Northern Hemisphere and to the left in the Southern Hemisphere. This deflection is strongest at the poles and weakest at the equator.\nThe centrifugal force acts on the wind because the wind is flowing in a curved path around the Earth. The centrifugal force is directed away from the center of the Earth, so it tends to push the wind outward.\n","geostrophic-and-gradient-wind#Geostrophic and Gradient wind":"Geostrophic and gradient winds are two types of atmospheric winds that are driven by a balance between different forces.\nGeostrophic wind is a theoretical wind that flows parallel to isobars (lines of equal pressure) in a balance between the pressure gradient force and the Coriolis effect. Geostrophic wind is most common in the upper atmosphere, where friction is low.\nGradient wind is a more realistic wind that flows parallel to isobars in a balance between the pressure gradient force, the Coriolis effect, and the centrifugal force. Centrifugal force is a fictitious force that acts on objects moving in a circular path. It is directed away from the center of the circle.\nThe main difference between geostrophic and gradient wind is that gradient wind takes into account the curvature of the isobars, while geostrophic wind does not. In reality, isobars are almost always curved, so gradient wind is a more realistic representation of the wind than geostrophic wind.\nExample:\nConsider a high pressure system in the Northern Hemisphere. The pressure gradient force will cause the wind to blow from the high pressure system towards the surrounding low pressure systems. However, the Coriolis effect will deflect the wind to the right. This will cause the wind to flow in a circular path around the high pressure system.\nThe centrifugal force will act on the wind because the wind is flowing in a circular path. The centrifugal force is directed away from the center of the high pressure system, so it will tend to push the wind outward.\nThe balance between the pressure gradient force, the Coriolis effect, and the centrifugal force will determine the direction and speed of the wind.

The angle between the wind and the pressure gradient force will depend on the strength of the Coriolis effect and the centrifugal force.\nThe Coriolis effect is strongest at the poles and weakest at the equator, so the angle between the wind and the pressure gradient force will be greatest at the poles and smallest at the equator.\nThe centrifugal force is proportional to the wind speed squared, so the angle between the wind and the pressure gradient force will also increase with wind speed.\nGradient wind is an important concept in meteorology because it helps us to understand the global circulation of the atmosphere and the formation of weather patterns.\n","give-examples-of-how-wind-is-affected-by--coriolis-and-centrifugal-effects-balance-motion#Give examples of how wind is affected by  Coriolis, and centrifugal effects balance motion":"Here are some examples of how wind is affected by Coriolis, and centrifugal effects balance motion:\nThe Coriolis effect is responsible for the direction of the prevailing winds, such as the trade winds and the westerlies.\nThe Coriolis effect also causes hurricanes and other cyclones to rotate in a counterclockwise direction in the Northern Hemisphere and clockwise direction in the Southern Hemisphere.\nThe centrifugal force helps to keep the wind flowing in a circular path around hurricanes and other cyclones.\nThe balance between wind effects, Coriolis, and centrifugal effects is a complex one, but it is essential for understanding the global circulation of the atmosphere and the formation of weather patterns.\n","how-the-jet-stream-affects-the-weather#How the jet stream affects the weather:":"The jet stream can affect the weather in a number of ways. For example, it can:\nSteer storms, such as hurricanes and tornadoes, around the globe. Influence the location of high- and low-pressure systems. Affect the temperature and precipitation patterns in different regions. For example, if the jet stream is further south than usual, it can bring warm, moist air from the tropics into the mid-latitudes. This can lead to heavy precipitation and thunderstorms.\nIf the jet stream is further north than usual, it can bring cold, dry air from the Arctic into the mid-latitudes. This can lead to cold snaps and snowstorms.\nThe jet stream is also affected by climate change. Climate change is causing the Earth\u0026rsquo;s atmosphere to warm. This is causing the jet stream to become weaker and more wavy. This can lead to more extreme weather events, such as heat waves, cold snaps, and droughts.\n","how-to-stay-safe-during-cyclostrophic-wind#How to stay safe during cyclostrophic wind:":"If you are in an area where cyclostrophic wind is possible, be aware of the signs and symptoms. These include a sudden drop in pressure, a loud roaring sound, and a rotating cloud.\nIf you see any of these signs, seek shelter immediately. The best shelter is a basement or interior room with no windows.\nIf you are caught outdoors, lie down in a ditch or other low-lying area and cover your head with your arms.\nStay tuned to local weather reports and follow the instructions of emergency personnel.","how-to-track-the-jet-stream#How to track the jet stream:":"The jet stream can be tracked using weather satellites and ground-based weather stations. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) provides daily updates on the jet stream\u0026rsquo;s location and strength.\nYou can track the jet stream yourself using a variety of online resources. For example, the National Weather Service website provides a number of jet stream maps and animations.\n","jet-stream#Jet Stream":"The jet stream is a narrow band of strong wind that flows from west to east high in the upper atmosphere. It is typically found between 6 and 12 miles (10 and 20 kilometers) above the surface of the Earth. The jet stream can reach speeds of up to 250 miles per hour (400 kilometers per hour).\nThe jet stream is caused by the temperature difference between the equator and the poles. The equator is warmer than the poles, so the air at the equator rises. As the air rises, it cools and flows towards the poles. When the air reaches the poles, it sinks and warms. This cycle of rising and sinking air creates the jet stream.\nThe jet stream is a very important feature of the Earth\u0026rsquo;s atmosphere. It helps to steer weather systems around the globe. The jet stream also helps to mix the air between the tropics and the poles, which helps to regulate the Earth\u0026rsquo;s temperature.\n","what-is-geostrophic-balance#What is Geostrophic Balance?":"The balance between the pressure gradient force, the Coriolis effect, and the centrifugal force determines the direction and speed of the wind.

In the lower atmosphere, friction plays a role in slowing down the wind and reducing the Coriolis effect.\n","wind-confluence#Wind Confluence":"What is wind confluence? Wind confluence is a pattern of wind flow in which air flows inward towards an axis that is oriented parallel to the general direction of flow. It is the opposite of diffluence. Wind confluence can be caused by a variety of factors, including:\nTopography: Mountains and valleys can channel wind, causing it to converge. Sea breezes: Sea breezes are caused by the differential heating between the land and the ocean during the day. The land heats up faster than the ocean, causing the air over the land to rise. This creates a region of low pressure over the land, and winds then blow from the ocean towards the land to fill in the low-pressure area. This convergence of winds at the coastline creates a sea breeze. Frontal systems: When a warm front and a cold front collide, they create a region of convergence where the warm air rises over the cold air. This convergence can lead to the development of clouds and precipitation. Upper-level troughs: Upper-level troughs are regions of low pressure in the upper levels of the atmosphere. As a trough passes over a region, it can create a region of confluence in the upper levels. This confluence can lead to the development of rising air, which can in turn lead to the formation of clouds and precipitation. What are the effects of wind confluence?\nWind confluence can have a significant impact on weather patterns. When winds converge, they force air to rise. This rising air cools and condenses, forming clouds and precipitation. Wind confluence can also lead to the development of strong winds, such as thunderstorms and tornadoes. Here are some specific examples of weather events that can be caused by wind confluence:\nThunderstorms: Thunderstorms often form in regions of upper-level divergence and surface convergence. The upper-level divergence helps to lift air, while the surface convergence helps to focus the lift. Tornadoes: Tornadoes can form in regions of strong upper-level divergence and surface convergence. The upper-level divergence helps to lift air, while the surface convergence helps to rotate the air. Hurricanes: Hurricanes form in regions of strong upper-level divergence and low-level convergence. The upper-level divergence helps to lift air, while the low-level convergence helps to organize the air into a rotating storm system. Wind confluence is an important factor in weather forecasting.

Wind diffluence is a pattern of wind flow in which air moves outward (in a \u0026ldquo;fan-out\u0026rdquo; pattern) away from a central axis that is oriented parallel to the general direction of the flow. It is the opposite of confluence. Diffluence is often associated with upper-level troughs in the atmosphere. As a trough passes over a region, it creates a region of diffluence in the upper levels. This diffluence can lead to the development of rising air, which can in turn lead to the formation of clouds and precipitation. Diffluence can also be found in the lower levels of the atmosphere. For example, difluence can occur along the coastline on a hot summer day. As the land heats up, it creates a low-pressure area over the land. Winds then blow from the ocean towards the land to fill in the low-pressure area. This convergence of winds at the coastline can lead to the formation of a sea breeze.\nWhat are the effects of wind diffluence?\nWind diffluence can have a significant impact on weather patterns.

It is calculated as the curl of the wind velocity. Vorticity is a vector quantity, meaning that it has both magnitude and direction. The magnitude of vorticity represents the strength of the rotation, while the direction of vorticity represents the axis around which the rotation is occurring. Wind vorticity can be either positive or negative. Positive vorticity indicates that the wind is rotating counterclockwise, while negative vorticity indicates that the wind is rotating clockwise.\nExplain the effects of Wind Vorticity.\nWind vorticity is an important quantity in meteorology because it is associated with a number of different weather phenomena, including:\nThunderstorms: Thunderstorms often form in regions of high vorticity. The vorticity helps to lift the air and create the instability that is necessary for thunderstorm development. Tornadoes: Tornadoes are formed by intense vortices. The vorticity of a tornado can be extremely high, which is why tornadoes are so destructive. Hurricanes: Hurricanes are also characterized by high vorticity. The vorticity of a hurricane helps to organize the storm and keep it together. Wind vorticity can also influence the movement of weather systems. For example, a trough in the upper atmosphere is associated with a positive vorticity anomaly. This positive vorticity anomaly can help to steer the trough and the associated weather system.\nWind vorticity is a complex topic, but it is an important concept to understand in order to understand weather forecasting. By understanding how wind vorticity can lead to the development of different weather events, meteorologists can better predict when and where these events will occur.\nHere are some additional examples of wind vorticity:\nWind shear: Wind shear is the change in wind speed or direction with distance. Wind shear can create vorticity, especially when it occurs in the horizontal plane. Surface friction: Surface friction can also create vorticity, especially in the lower levels of the atmosphere. Mountain ranges: Mountain ranges can channel wind and create vorticity. Frontal systems: Frontal systems can also create vorticity, especially where the warm front and cold front intersect.

This is due to human-caused climate change, which is increasing the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Greenhouse gases trap heat in the atmosphere, which causes the Earth\u0026rsquo;s temperature to rise.\nThe extra heat that is being absorbed by the oceans is causing them to warm.

Glaciers can move ice from high altitudes to lower altitudes.\nIce plays an important role in the global climate system. Ice reflects sunlight back into space, which helps to keep the Earth cool. Ice also stores a large amount of fresh water. If all of the ice on Earth were to melt, sea level would rise by about 70 meters.\n","ice-decay#Ice decay:":"Ice decays when it melts or sublimates. Melting occurs when the ice warms up above its freezing point. Sublimation occurs when the ice directly transitions from a solid to a gas without going through a liquid phase. Sublimation can occur even at temperatures below freezing, but it is more likely to occur at higher temperatures and lower pressures.\nThe rate of ice decay is influenced by a number of factors, including temperature, pressure, wind speed, and solar radiation. Ice will decay more quickly at higher temperatures and lower pressures. Wind speed can also increase the rate of ice decay by blowing away warm air and bringing in cold air. Solar radiation can also cause ice to decay by melting the surface of the ice.\n","ice-formation#Ice formation:":"Ice forms when water cools below its freezing point (0 degrees Celsius or 32 degrees Fahrenheit). However, water can remain liquid below its freezing point if it is pure and undisturbed. This is because water molecules are constantly moving and colliding with each other. When a water molecule collides with another water molecule, it can transfer some of its energy to the other molecule. This energy transfer can prevent the water molecules from slowing down enough to form ice crystals.\nHowever, if there is a small impurity in the water, such as a dust particle or a snowflake, it can provide a surface for the water molecules to cling to. This can help to initiate the formation of ice crystals. Once ice crystals begin to form, they can grow rapidly by attracting more water molecules.\n"},"title":"Ice"},"/docs/partc/em301/oceanogeo/mohole/":{"data":{"":"","contributions-of-the-mohole-project#Contributions of the Mohole project":"The Mohole project made a number of important contributions to our understanding of the Earth\u0026rsquo;s interior, including:\nConfirmation of the Moho: The project confirmed the existence of the Moho, which had previously been inferred from seismic data.\nImproved understanding of the ocean floor: The project provided new data about the structure and composition of the ocean floor.\nAdvances in deep-sea drilling technology: The project helped to develop new technologies for deep-sea drilling, which have been used in subsequent projects.\n","future-of-deep-sea-drilling#Future of deep-sea drilling":"The Mohole project was a pioneering effort to drill through the Earth\u0026rsquo;s crust.

Warmer and saltier water is denser than colder and fresher water. Therefore, warmer and saltier water masses tend to sink below colder and fresher water masses. This sinking creates a pressure gradient that drives the movement of subsurface ocean currents.\nWind: Wind can also influence subsurface ocean currents. For example, the Southern Ocean Circumpolar Current is driven by the strong westerly winds that blow around Antarctica.\nLandmasses: Landmasses can also influence the direction of subsurface ocean currents. For example, the North Atlantic Deep Water is deflected westward by the Mid-Atlantic Ridge.\nThe circulation of ocean currents is a complex process that is influenced by a variety of factors. However, the main driving forces of ocean circulation are wind, density differences, and the Coriolis effect.\nSurface and subsurface ocean currents play an important role in global climate and ocean circulation. They transport heat and nutrients around the globe, and they can influence the formation of storms and other weather patterns.\nThermohaline current The thermohaline current, also known as the global ocean conveyor belt, is a system of deep ocean currents that is driven by differences in temperature (thermo) and salinity (haline). It is the largest circulatory system on Earth, and it plays an important role in regulating global climate.\nThe thermohaline current begins in the North Atlantic Ocean, where cold, salty water sinks to the bottom of the ocean. This dense water then flows southward, eventually spreading out into all of the world\u0026rsquo;s oceans. As the water flows, it gradually warms up and becomes less saline. Eventually, the water rises to the surface and flows back to the North Atlantic Ocean, where the cycle begins again.\nThe thermohaline current is important because it helps to transport heat from the equator to the poles. This heat helps to keep the poles from becoming too cold, and it also helps to influence the formation of weather patterns.\nThere is some concern that climate change could disrupt the thermohaline current. As the Earth warms, the Greenland ice sheet is melting, and this freshwater is diluting the salinity of the North Atlantic Ocean. This could make it more difficult for cold, salty water to sink to the bottom of the ocean, which could weaken the thermohaline current.\nIf the thermohaline current were to weaken, it could have a significant impact on global climate. The poles could become colder, and weather patterns could change. This could lead to more extreme weather events, such as droughts and floods.\nScientists are still studying the potential impacts of climate change on the thermohaline current. However, it is clear that this important system is vulnerable to change.\n","surface-ocean-currents-are-driven-by-a-combination-of-factors-including#Surface ocean currents are driven by a combination of factors, including:":"Wind: Wind is the primary driving force of surface ocean currents. As wind blows across the ocean, it drags the surface water along with it. The direction of a surface current is generally determined by the direction of the prevailing wind.\nCoriolis effect: The Coriolis effect is a deflection of moving objects caused by the Earth\u0026rsquo;s rotation. In the Northern Hemisphere, the Coriolis effect deflects moving objects to the right, and in the Southern Hemisphere, it deflects them to the left. This deflection has a significant impact on the direction of surface ocean currents.\nLandmasses: Landmasses can also influence the direction of surface ocean currents. For example, the Gulf Stream is deflected northward by the eastern coast of North America.\n"},"title":"Surface Ocean Currents"},"/docs/partc/em301/oceanogeo/rocks/":{"data":{"":"","discuss-genesis-of-rocks#Discuss Genesis of Rocks":"Rocks are formed through a variety of geological processes, which can be broadly classified into three main types:\nIgneous rocks are formed from the cooling and solidification of molten magma or lava. Magma is generated within the Earth\u0026rsquo;s mantle, and can rise to the surface and erupt as lava, or cool and solidify underground. Igneous rocks are typically classified based on their composition and texture. Some common examples of igneous rocks include granite, basalt, and obsidian.\nSedimentary rocks are formed from the accumulation and compaction of sediments. Sediments can be derived from the weathering and erosion of existing rocks, or from the precipitation of minerals from solution. Sedimentary rocks are typically classified based on their composition and texture. Some common examples of sedimentary rocks include sandstone, limestone, and shale.\nMetamorphic rocks are formed when existing rocks are subjected to high temperatures and pressures. This can happen during mountain building events, or when rocks are buried deeply within the Earth\u0026rsquo;s crust. Metamorphic rocks are typically classified based on their composition and texture. Some common examples of metamorphic rocks include marble, gneiss, and quartzite.\n","distribution-of-rocks-in-the-continents-and-oceans#Distribution of rocks in the continents and oceans":"The distribution of rocks on the Earth\u0026rsquo;s surface is not uniform. Igneous rocks are typically found in areas of recent volcanic activity, such as the mid-ocean ridges and the Pacific Ring of Fire. Sedimentary rocks are typically found in sedimentary basins, which are areas where sediments have accumulated over time. Metamorphic rocks are typically found in mountain ranges, where they have been subjected to high temperatures and pressures.\nIn general, the continents are dominated by igneous and metamorphic rocks, while the oceans are dominated by sedimentary rocks. This is because the continents have been subjected to more geological activity over time than the oceans.\nHere are some specific examples of the distribution of rocks in the continents and oceans:\nNorth America: The Rocky Mountains are composed of a variety of metamorphic rocks, while the Great Plains are covered in sedimentary rocks. The Appalachian Mountains are composed of a variety of igneous and metamorphic rocks.\nSouth America: The Andes Mountains are composed of a variety of igneous and metamorphic rocks, while the Amazon rainforest is covered in sedimentary rocks.\nEurope: The Alps are composed of a variety of metamorphic rocks, while the North European Plain is covered in sedimentary rocks.\nAsia: The Himalayas are composed of a variety of igneous and metamorphic rocks, while the Gobi Desert is covered in sedimentary rocks.\nAfrica: The Great Rift Valley is composed of a variety of igneous rocks, while the Sahara Desert is covered in sedimentary rocks.\nAustralia: The Great Dividing Range is composed of a variety of igneous and metamorphic rocks, while the Outback is covered in sedimentary rocks.\nOceans: The ocean floors are covered in a variety of sedimentary rocks, with some areas also containing igneous rocks.\nIt is important to note that the distribution of rocks on the Earth\u0026rsquo;s surface is constantly changing due to geological processes such as erosion, weathering, and plate tectonics.\n","types-of-rocks#Types of rocks":"There are many different types of rocks, but they can be broadly classified into the three main types mentioned above: igneous, sedimentary, and metamorphic.

Intrusive igneous rocks cool and solidify slowly underground, while extrusive igneous rocks cool and solidify quickly at the surface.\nSedimentary rocks can be divided into three main types: clastic, chemical, and organic. Clastic sedimentary rocks are formed from fragments of other rocks, while chemical sedimentary rocks are formed from the precipitation of minerals from solution. Organic sedimentary rocks are formed from the remains of dead organisms.\nMetamorphic rocks can be divided into two main types: foliated and non-foliated.

The ocean floor is divided into three main regions: the abyssal plain, the mid-ocean ridges, and the deep-sea trenches. Coastline and beaches\nThe coastline is the boundary between the land and the sea. Coastlines can be classified into two main types: erosional and depositional.\nErosional coastlines are characterized by cliffs, rocky shores, and other features that have been created by the erosion of the land by the sea. Depositional coastlines are characterized by beaches, sand dunes, and other features that have been created by the deposition of sediment by the sea.\nBeaches are narrow strips of sand or gravel that are located along the coastline. Beaches are formed by the deposition of sediment by the waves and currents. Beaches can vary in size and shape depending on the location and the type of sediment that is available.\nConclusion The seas are important ecosystems that provide a variety of benefits to humans, including food, recreation, and transportation.

It has a number of unique physical properties, including:\nSalinity: Salinity is a measure of the amount of dissolved salts in seawater. It is typically expressed in parts per thousand (ppt). The average salinity of seawater is about 35 ppt, but it can vary depending on location and depth.\nDensity: Density is a measure of how much mass is contained in a given volume. Seawater is denser than fresh water because of the dissolved salts. The density of seawater also increases with depth due to increasing pressure.\nTemperature: The temperature of seawater varies depending on location, depth, and time of year. The average temperature of seawater at the surface is about 20°C, but it can range from below freezing to over 30°C.\npH: pH is a measure of how acidic or alkaline a substance is. Seawater is slightly alkaline, with a pH of about 8.2. Light penetration and color of the sea\nColour of Seawater When sunlight hits the ocean surface, some of it is reflected back into the atmosphere and some of it is absorbed by the water. The amount of light that is absorbed depends on the wavelength of the light and the clarity of the water.\nRed, orange, and yellow light have longer wavelengths and are absorbed more quickly by water than blue and green light. This is why the ocean appears blue to the human eye. The clearest ocean waters can absorb up to 99% of the sunlight within the first 100 meters of depth.\nThe color of the ocean can also be affected by the presence of suspended particles and dissolved substances. For example, phytoplankton, which are tiny algae that live in the ocean, can absorb blue light, making the water appear more green. And sediment in the water can absorb all wavelengths of light, making the water appear brown or muddy.\nOverall, the physical properties of seawater, light penetration, and the color of the sea are all interrelated. The salinity, density, temperature, and pH of seawater all affect how light interacts with the water. And the presence of suspended particles and dissolved substances can also affect the color of the water.\n"},"title":"Physical properties of seawater, light penetration and colour of the sea"},"/docs/partc/em301/oceanogeo/tectonics/":{"data":{"":"","counter-arguments#Counter Arguments":"Another area of debate is the role of plate tectonics in the early history of the Earth.

This would have made it more difficult for the crust to break into plates.\nHowever, there is also evidence to suggest that plate tectonics may have begun early. For example, some scientists have found evidence of plate tectonics in rocks that are over 3 billion years old.\nOther areas of debate\nThere are a number of other areas of debate related to the plate tectonic model, such as the nature of the asthenosphere (the layer of the mantle below the lithosphere), the role of mantle plumes, and the evolution of plate boundaries over time.\nConclusion\nThe plate tectonic model is a very successful theory that has revolutionized our understanding of the Earth.

The movement of the magma creates convection currents, which drag the plates along with them.\nSlab pull: This hypothesis proposes that the cool, dense oceanic crust sinks beneath the continents at convergent boundaries. This sinking creates a pull on the rest of the plate, which drives plate motion.\nRidge push: This hypothesis proposes that the hot, buoyant magma at divergent boundaries pushes the plates apart.

This is because the sun\u0026rsquo;s rays are more intense at the equator, which causes the water to evaporate and leave behind the salt. The evaporated water then travels to the poles, where it condenses and falls as precipitation. This precipitation dilutes the salinity of the ocean water and lowers its temperature.\nDepth: Salinity and temperature generally decrease with increasing depth. This is because the sun\u0026rsquo;s rays cannot penetrate very deep into the ocean, so the water is not as warm. Additionally, the pressure at greater depths is higher, which causes the water to become denser.\nOcean currents: Ocean currents can transport water masses from one region to another, which can have a significant impact on the distribution of salinity, temperature, and density. For example, the Gulf Stream transports warm, salty water from the Gulf of Mexico to the North Atlantic Ocean. This warm water helps to keep the North Atlantic Ocean relatively warm, even in the winter months.\nWater Masses: Water masses are defined by their characteristic salinity and temperature properties. They are formed when water with a specific salinity and temperature range sinks below the surrounding water. This sinking can occur at high latitudes, where the water is very cold and dense, or at convergences, where two different water masses meet.\nOnce a water mass has formed, it can travel long distances throughout the ocean. Water masses play an important role in global climate and ocean circulation. They transport heat and nutrients around the globe, and they can influence the formation of storms and other weather patterns.\nHere is a general overview of the distribution of salinity, temperature, and density in the world\u0026rsquo;s oceans: Surface salinity: Surface salinity is highest in the subtropics and tropics, where the sun\u0026rsquo;s rays are most intense. It is lowest in the polar regions, where there is more precipitation and less evaporation.\nSurface temperature: Surface temperature is also highest in the subtropics and tropics, and lowest in the polar regions. However, there are also significant regional variations in surface temperature. For example, the eastern equatorial Pacific Ocean is much cooler than the western equatorial Pacific Ocean. This is due to the upwelling of cold water from the deep ocean in the eastern Pacific.\nDeep ocean salinity and temperature: The deep ocean is much colder and more saline than the surface ocean. This is because the deep ocean is not warmed by the sun\u0026rsquo;s rays, and it is under a great deal of pressure.\nWater masses: The world\u0026rsquo;s oceans can be divided into a number of different water masses, each with its own characteristic salinity and temperature properties. Some of the most important water masses include:\nCentral Water: Central Water is found in the central basins of the world\u0026rsquo;s oceans. It is typically warm and salty.\nSubtropical Water: Subtropical Water is found in the subtropics and tropics. It is typically very warm and salty.\nSubpolar Water: Subpolar Water is found in the subpolar regions. It is typically cold and salty.\nPolar Water: Polar Water is found in the polar regions. It is very cold and fresh.\nWater masses move around the globe through ocean currents. For example, the Gulf Stream transports Central Water from the Gulf of Mexico to the North Atlantic Ocean. The North Atlantic Drift then transports this water further north, where it eventually sinks and forms North Atlantic Deep Water. North Atlantic Deep Water is a very cold and dense water mass that sinks to the bottom of the ocean and flows southward. It eventually spreads out into all of the world\u0026rsquo;s oceans.\nThe distribution of salinity, temperature, and density of water masses has a significant impact on marine life and ecosystems. For example, some marine organisms are adapted to living in specific salinity and temperature ranges. Additionally, the movement of water masses can transport nutrients and food sources around the globe, which can influence the distribution of marine life.\n","the-distribution-of-salinity-temperature-and-density-of-water-masses-is-determined-by-a-number-of-factors-including#The distribution of salinity, temperature, and density of water masses is determined by a number of factors, including:":""},"title":"Distribution of Salinity, Temperature and Density of Water"},"/docs/partc/em301/satmet/":{"data":{"":"","contents#Contents":"Contents Historical development.

Vanguard 2 was designed to measure cloud cover distribution over the daylight portion of its orbit and to provide information on the density of the atmosphere. However, Vanguard 2 failed to achieve orbit, and it was not until 1960 that the first successful weather satellite, TIROS-1, was launched.\nTIROS-1 was a polar-orbiting satellite that carried two television cameras. It provided the first global images of the Earth\u0026rsquo;s cloud cover, and it revolutionized the way that meteorologists monitored weather systems. TIROS-1 was followed by a series of increasingly sophisticated polar-orbiting weather satellites, including the Nimbus and NOAA series.\nIn 1966, the United States launched ATS-1, the first geostationary weather satellite. Geostationary satellites orbit the Earth at an altitude of approximately 22,236 miles, and they remain in a fixed position over a particular point on the Earth\u0026rsquo;s surface. This makes them ideal for monitoring weather systems and providing real-time images of the Earth\u0026rsquo;s cloud cover.\nToday, there are dozens of weather satellites in orbit around Earth, operated by a variety of nations and international organizations. These satellites provide meteorologists with a wealth of data about the Earth\u0026rsquo;s atmosphere, including cloud cover, temperature, moisture, and wind speed. This data is used to improve weather forecasts and to track severe weather events, such as hurricanes, tornadoes, and thunderstorms.\n","key-milestones-in-the-historical-development-of-satellite-meteorology#Key milestones in the historical development of satellite meteorology:":"1957: Launch of Sputnik 1, the first artificial satellite to orbit Earth.\n1959: Launch of Vanguard 2, the first weather satellite.\n1960: Launch of TIROS-1, the first successful weather satellite.\n1966: Launch of ATS-1, the first geostationary weather satellite.\n1970s: Development of the Nimbus and NOAA series of polar-orbiting weather satellites.\n1980s: Development of the GOES and Meteosat series of geostationary weather satellites.\n1990s: Development of new weather satellite sensors, such as microwave radiometers and infrared sounders.\n2000s: Launch of a new generation of weather satellites, such as the NPP and JPSS series in the United States and the FY-3 series in China."},"title":"History of Satellite Meteorology"},"/docs/partc/em301/satmet/sattropic/":{"data":{"":" Satellite data is essential for tropical storm analysis.

The height of the tides varies depending on the phase of the moon, the position of the sun relative to the moon, and the local geography. Tidal forces on the solid Earth: Tidal forces cause the solid Earth to flex slightly, causing the tides. The solid Earth is not as flexible as the oceans, so the tides in the solid Earth are much smaller than the tides in the oceans. Tidal forces on the atmosphere: Tidal forces also have an effect on the atmosphere. The atmosphere is pulled towards the moon and the sun, creating a bulge in the atmosphere on the side of the Earth that is closest to the moon and the sun. The bulge in the atmosphere creates a slight pressure difference between the two sides of the Earth, which drives winds. Tidal forces on other planets and moons: Tidal forces have an effect on other planets and moons in the solar system. For example, the moon\u0026rsquo;s tidal forces on the Earth cause the Earth to rotate more slowly over time. The Earth\u0026rsquo;s tidal forces on the moon have caused the moon to become tidally locked to the Earth, which means that the same side of the moon always faces the Earth. Tidal forces are a complex and fascinating topic. They play an important role in the Earth\u0026rsquo;s oceans, atmosphere, and solid Earth. Tidal forces also have an effect on other planets and moons in the solar system.","tidal-forces-are-the-gravitational-forces-that-cause-the-tides#Tidal forces are the gravitational forces that cause the tides.":"Tidal forces are the gravitational forces that cause the tides. They are caused by the gravitational pull of the moon and the sun on the Earth. The moon\u0026rsquo;s gravity has a stronger effect than the sun\u0026rsquo;s gravity because the moon is closer to the Earth.\nTidal forces are differential forces, which means that they pull differently on different parts of the Earth. The part of the Earth that is closest to the moon is pulled more strongly than the part of the Earth that is farthest from the moon. This creates a bulge in the Earth\u0026rsquo;s oceans on the side of the Earth that is closest to the moon.\nThere is also a bulge in the Earth\u0026rsquo;s oceans on the opposite side of the Earth from the moon. This is because the centrifugal force created by the Earth\u0026rsquo;s rotation pushes the water away from the center of the Earth on the opposite side of the Earth from the moon.\nThe two bulges in the Earth\u0026rsquo;s oceans create the tides. The high tide is located under the two bulges, and the low tide is located between the two bulges.\nThe sun also has an effect on the tides, but its effect is weaker than the moon\u0026rsquo;s effect because the sun is farther away from the Earth. When the sun and moon are aligned, their gravitational forces combine to produce spring tides. Spring tides are the highest tides of the month. When the sun and moon are at right angles to each other, their gravitational forces cancel each other out, producing neap tides. Neap tides are the lowest tides of the month.\nTidal forces also have an effect on the solid Earth. The solid Earth is not as flexible as the oceans, so it does not bulge as much as the oceans. However, the solid Earth does flex slightly, causing the tides.\nTidal forces also have an effect on other planets and moons in the solar system. For example, the moon\u0026rsquo;s tidal forces on the Earth cause the Earth to rotate more slowly over time.

Tidal streams are caused by the gravitational pull of the moon and sun on the Earth\u0026rsquo;s oceans. They are predictable and follow a regular cycle, with the direction and speed of the current changing with the tides. Tidal streams are strongest in coastal areas and estuaries, where the water is confined and the tidal range is high.\nCurrents can be caused by a variety of factors, including wind, waves, and water temperature. They can be constant or variable in direction and speed, and they can occur anywhere in the ocean.\nMeasurement of tidal streams and currents Tidal streams and currents can be measured using a variety of methods, including:\nCurrent meters: These instruments measure the speed and direction of the current at a specific point. ADCPs (Acoustic Doppler Current Profilers): These instruments use sound waves to measure the speed and direction of the current at different depths. Radar: Radar can be used to track the movement of surface currents. Satellite imagery: Satellite imagery can be used to track the movement of currents over large areas. Importance of measuring tidal streams and currents Measuring tidal streams and currents is important for a variety of reasons, including:\nNavigation: Tidal streams and currents can affect the speed and direction of ships, so it is important for mariners to know about them when planning their voyages. Offshore activities: Tidal streams and currents can affect the positioning and operation of offshore structures, such as oil platforms and wind turbines. Fisheries management: Tidal streams and currents can transport fish larvae and eggs, so it is important to understand them when managing fisheries. Coastal erosion: Tidal streams and currents can contribute to coastal erosion, so it is important to understand them when planning coastal protection measures. Predicting tidal streams and currents Tidal streams and currents can be predicted using a variety of mathematical models. These models take into account the gravitational forces of the moon and sun, the shape of the coastline, and the depth of the water.\nTidal stream and current predictions are available from a variety of sources, including government agencies, private companies, and websites. These predictions can be used by mariners, offshore operators, fisheries managers, and coastal planners.\n","tidal-streams-and-currents-are-both-movements-of-water-in-the-ocean-but-they-have-different-causes-and-characteristics#Tidal streams and currents are both movements of water in the ocean, but they have different causes and characteristics.":""},"title":"Tidal Streams,currents and their measurement"},"/docs/partc/em301/tides/typoftides/":{"data":{"":"Tides can be classified in a number of ways, including by frequency, range, and type.","examples#Examples":"Here are some examples of different types of tides:\nDiurnal tides: Diurnal tides are common in the tropics, where the moon passes overhead twice a day. Semi-diurnal tides: Semi-diurnal tides are common in temperate and polar regions, where the moon passes overhead once a day. Mixed tides: Mixed tides are found in many coastal areas, where the shape of the coastline and the ocean basin can affect the frequency of the tides. Microtidal tides: Microtidal tides are found along most of the coast of California. Mesotidal tides: Mesotidal tides are found along most of the coast of the United States, as well as along the coasts of Europe and Asia. Macrotidal tides: Macrotidal tides are found along the coast of Canada, the Bay of Fundy, and the coast of Patagonia. Astronomical tides: Astronomical tides are the most common type of tide. They are caused by the gravitational pull of the moon and the sun. Meteorological tides: Meteorological tides are less common than astronomical tides. They are caused by atmospheric pressure changes and winds. Seiches: Seiches are rare, but they can occur in enclosed or semi-enclosed bodies of water, such as lakes and bays. Tides are a complex phenomenon that is influenced by a variety of factors. However, the classification of tides by frequency, range, and type can help us to better understand and predict the tides.\n","frequency#Frequency":"Tides can be classified by frequency based on the number of high and low tides that occur each day. The three main types of tidal frequencies are:\nDiurnal tides: One high tide and one low tide per day. Semi-diurnal tides: Two high tides and two low tides per day. Mixed tides: A combination of diurnal and semi-diurnal tides, with the number of high and low tides varying per day. ","range#Range":"Tides can also be classified by range, which is the difference in height between the high and low tides. The three main types of tidal ranges are:\nMicrotidal tides: A range of less than 2 meters. Mesotidal tides: A range of 2 to 4 meters. Macrotidal tides: A range of more than 4 meters. ","type#Type":"Tides can also be classified by type, based on the forces that cause them. The three main types of tides are:\nAstronomical tides: Caused by the gravitational pull of the moon and the sun. Meteorological tides: Caused by atmospheric pressure changes and winds. Seiches: Caused by the resonant oscillation of water in enclosed or semi-enclosed bodies of water, such as lakes and bays.

However, this should be a last resort, as it is expensive and time-consuming.\nTips for avoiding charter party disputes There are a number of things that charterers and shipowners can do to avoid charter party disputes:\nNegotiate the charter party carefully: Before signing a charter party, it is important to carefully negotiate all of the terms of the contract. This includes the freight rate, laytime, demurrage and despatch provisions, loading and discharging obligations, and havarie clauses. Get everything in writing: All agreements between the charterer and shipowner should be in writing and signed by both parties. This includes any amendments or modifications to the charter party. Be clear about your expectations: Both the charterer and shipowner should clearly communicate their expectations to each other in writing. This includes expectations regarding the loading and discharging process, the condition of the cargo, and the performance of the charter party. Monitor the charter party performance: Both the charterer and shipowner should monitor the performance of the charter party and take action if there are any problems. This includes monitoring the loading and discharging process, the condition of the cargo, and the overall performance of the vessel. Conclusion\nCharter party disputes can be complex and costly.
