        &lt;h2&gt;What is ABNJ?&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;what-is-abnj&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#what-is-abnj&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Areas beyond national jurisdiction (ABNJ) are those parts of the ocean that are not under the control of any one country. They cover about 64% of the ocean&amp;rsquo;s surface and 95% of its volume, making them the largest global commons on Earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ABNJ are home to a wide range of marine life and ecosystems, including many that are unique and found nowhere else on the planet. They also play a vital role in regulating the climate and providing essential resources to people around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, ABNJ are facing a number of challenges, including overfishing, pollution, and climate change. These challenges are interconnected and require a coordinated response from the global community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The conservation and management of resources in ABNJ is governed by a number of international agreements, including the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) and the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD). These agreements provide a framework for cooperation on a range of issues, including fisheries, shipping, and environmental protection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to international agreements, there are also a number of regional and subregional organizations that play a role in the conservation and management of ABNJ resources. These organizations work to coordinate management efforts and develop common standards and practices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Despite the existence of these agreements and organizations, there are still a number of challenges to the effective conservation and management of ABNJ resources. These challenges include:&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;despite-the-existence-of-these-agreements-and-organizations-there-are-still-a-number-of-challenges-to-the-effective-conservation-and-management-of-abnj-resources-these-challenges-include&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#despite-the-existence-of-these-agreements-and-organizations-there-are-still-a-number-of-challenges-to-the-effective-conservation-and-management-of-abnj-resources-these-challenges-include&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The fragmentation of the international ocean governance system&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The lack of effective enforcement mechanisms for international agreements&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The capacity constraints of developing countries&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The increasing pressure on marine resources from human activities&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite these challenges, there is a growing recognition of the importance of ABNJ conservation and management. The United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 14 calls for &amp;ldquo;conserving and sustainably using the oceans, seas and marine resources for sustainable development.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;There are a number of things that can be done to improve the conservation and management of ABNJ resources, including:&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;there-are-a-number-of-things-that-can-be-done-to-improve-the-conservation-and-management-of-abnj-resources-including&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#there-are-a-number-of-things-that-can-be-done-to-improve-the-conservation-and-management-of-abnj-resources-including&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strengthening international cooperation and coordination&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Improving the enforcement of international agreements&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Building capacity in developing countries&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Promoting sustainable ocean-based economies&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Raising public awareness of the importance of ABNJ conservation and sustainable use
Here are some specific examples of conservation and management measures that are being implemented in ABNJ:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Fishery management:&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;fishery-management&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#fishery-management&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regional fisheries management organizations (RFMOs) have been established to manage fisheries in ABNJ. RFMOs set catch limits, establish fishing seasons, and implement other measures to ensure the sustainable management of fish stocks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Marine protected areas:&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;marine-protected-areas&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#marine-protected-areas&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Marine protected areas (MPAs) can be used to protect vulnerable marine ecosystems and biodiversity in ABNJ. MPAs can be established through international agreements or by individual countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Pollution prevention and control:&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;pollution-prevention-and-control&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#pollution-prevention-and-control&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;A number of international agreements are in place to prevent and control pollution in ABNJ. These agreements address a range of pollutants, including oil, sewage, and hazardous substances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Climate change adaptation:&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;climate-change-adaptation&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#climate-change-adaptation&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The impacts of climate change are already being felt in ABNJ, and these impacts are expected to become more severe in the future. A number of international organizations and initiatives are working to help countries adapt to the impacts of climate change in ABNJ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The conservation and management of ABNJ resources is a complex and challenging task. However, it is essential that we find ways to manage these resources sustainably for the benefit of current and future generations.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;h2&gt;What is CCRF?&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;what-is-ccrf&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#what-is-ccrf&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The FAO Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries (CCRF) is a voluntary international instrument that sets out principles and standards for the conservation, management and development of living aquatic resources. It was adopted by the FAO Conference in 1995 and has since been endorsed by over 180 countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The CCRF is based on the following principles:&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;the-ccrf-is-based-on-the-following-principles&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#the-ccrf-is-based-on-the-following-principles&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The precautionary approach:&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;the-precautionary-approach&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#the-precautionary-approach&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;States should act with caution when taking decisions that could have a negative impact on living aquatic resources, even if there is no scientific certainty that such an impact will occur.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Ecosystem approach:&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;ecosystem-approach&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#ecosystem-approach&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;States should manage living aquatic resources in a way that takes into account the interconnectedness of ecosystems and the need to protect biodiversity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Good governance:&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;good-governance&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#good-governance&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;States should develop and implement policies and measures for the conservation, management and development of living aquatic resources in a participatory and transparent manner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Sustainable use:&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;sustainable-use&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#sustainable-use&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;States should ensure that living aquatic resources are used in a sustainable manner, so that they can be used for present and future generations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The CCRF covers a wide range of issues, including:&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;the-ccrf-covers-a-wide-range-of-issues-including&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#the-ccrf-covers-a-wide-range-of-issues-including&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Fisheries management:&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;fisheries-management&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#fisheries-management&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CCRF provides guidance on how to develop and implement effective fisheries management measures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Aquaculture:&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;aquaculture&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#aquaculture&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CCRF provides guidance on how to develop and implement sustainable aquaculture practices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Research and development:&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;research-and-development&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#research-and-development&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CCRF emphasizes the importance of research and development in supporting the conservation, management and development of living aquatic resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;International cooperation:&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;international-cooperation&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#international-cooperation&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CCRF encourages states to cooperate with each other on the conservation, management and development of shared living aquatic resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CCRF is a valuable tool for governments, fishers, aquaculture operators, and other stakeholders involved in the fisheries and aquaculture sectors. It provides a framework for responsible and sustainable practices that can help to ensure the long-term health of living aquatic resources and the benefits they provide to people around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Here are some examples of how the CCRF is being implemented:&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;here-are-some-examples-of-how-the-ccrf-is-being-implemented&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#here-are-some-examples-of-how-the-ccrf-is-being-implemented&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In many countries, the CCRF has been used to develop national fisheries management plans.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The CCRF has also been used to develop regional fisheries management organizations (RFMOs), which are responsible for managing shared fish stocks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the aquaculture sector, the CCRF has been used to develop standards for sustainable aquaculture practices.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The CCRF is also being used to promote international cooperation on fisheries and aquaculture issues.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The CCRF is not a legally binding instrument, but it is a highly respected and influential document. It has played an important role in raising awareness of the need for responsible fisheries and aquaculture practices.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        &lt;h2&gt;What is Ocean Governance?&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;what-is-ocean-governance&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#what-is-ocean-governance&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ocean governance is the process by which the world&amp;rsquo;s oceans are managed and used. It encompasses a wide range of actors and institutions, including governments, international organizations, businesses, civil society groups, and individuals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ocean governance is important because the oceans play a vital role in the global economy and environment. They provide food, jobs, transportation, and recreation. They also regulate the climate, produce oxygen, and support a wide range of biodiversity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the oceans are facing a number of challenges, including climate change, overfishing, pollution, and habitat destruction. These challenges are interconnected and require a coordinated response from the global community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a number of international agreements that govern the oceans, including the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). UNCLOS is the most comprehensive international treaty on ocean affairs, and it provides a framework for cooperation on a wide range of issues, including fisheries, shipping, and environmental protection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to international agreements, there are also a number of regional and national ocean governance institutions. Regional organizations, such as the European Union and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), play an important role in coordinating ocean management within their respective regions. National governments are also responsible for developing and implementing ocean policies within their own territorial waters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ocean governance is a complex and challenging task. However, it is essential that we find ways to manage the oceans sustainably for the benefit of current and future generations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Here are some of the key goals of ocean governance:&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;here-are-some-of-the-key-goals-of-ocean-governance&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#here-are-some-of-the-key-goals-of-ocean-governance&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To protect and conserve marine ecosystems and biodiversity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To sustainably manage marine resources&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To reduce and prevent marine pollution&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To promote the peaceful uses of the oceans&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To ensure the safety and security of maritime navigation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To strengthen international cooperation on ocean issues&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Some of the challenges facing ocean governance include:&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;some-of-the-challenges-facing-ocean-governance-include&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#some-of-the-challenges-facing-ocean-governance-include&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The fragmentation of the international ocean governance system&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The lack of effective enforcement mechanisms for international agreements&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The capacity constraints of developing countries&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The increasing pressure on marine resources from human activities&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite these challenges, there is a growing recognition of the importance of ocean governance. The United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 14 calls for &amp;ldquo;conserving and sustainably using the oceans, seas and marine resources for sustainable development.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;There are a number of things that can be done to improve ocean governance, including:&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;there-are-a-number-of-things-that-can-be-done-to-improve-ocean-governance-including&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#there-are-a-number-of-things-that-can-be-done-to-improve-ocean-governance-including&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strengthening international cooperation and coordination&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Improving the enforcement of international agreements&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Building capacity in developing countries&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Promoting sustainable ocean-based economies&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Raising public awareness of the importance of ocean conservation and sustainable use&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ocean governance is a complex and challenging task, but it is essential that we find ways to manage the oceans sustainably for the benefit of current and future generations.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>
        
        
        &lt;h2&gt;What is UNFSA?&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;what-is-unfsa&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#what-is-unfsa&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The United Nations Agreement on the Conservation and Management of Straddling Fish Stocks and Highly Migratory Fish Stocks (UNFSA) is an international agreement that aims to ensure the long-term conservation and sustainable use of straddling fish stocks and highly migratory fish stocks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Straddling fish stocks are those that occur both within the exclusive economic zones (EEZs) of coastal states and in the high seas. Highly migratory fish stocks are those that migrate across the EEZs of two or more coastal states or extend into the high seas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UNFSA was adopted in 1995 and entered into force in 2001.&lt;/strong&gt;* It is currently one of the most important international agreements governing fisheries management.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;UNFSA sets out a number of principles and obligations for states in relation to the conservation and management of straddling fish stocks and highly migratory fish stocks. These include:&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;unfsa-sets-out-a-number-of-principles-and-obligations-for-states-in-relation-to-the-conservation-and-management-of-straddling-fish-stocks-and-highly-migratory-fish-stocks-these-include&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#unfsa-sets-out-a-number-of-principles-and-obligations-for-states-in-relation-to-the-conservation-and-management-of-straddling-fish-stocks-and-highly-migratory-fish-stocks-these-include&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The precautionary approach: States must act with caution when taking decisions that could have a negative impact on straddling fish stocks and highly migratory fish stocks, even if there is no scientific certainty that such an impact will occur.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The best available scientific information: States must base their decisions on the best available scientific information.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Compatibility: States must ensure that their conservation and management measures are compatible with those of other states that are fishing the same stocks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Transparency: States must be transparent about their conservation and management measures and the data on which they are based.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What are RFMOs?&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;what-are-rfmos&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#what-are-rfmos&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;UNFSA also establishes a number of mechanisms for cooperation between states, including through regional fisheries management organizations (RFMOs). RFMOs are responsible for developing and implementing conservation and management measures for straddling fish stocks and highly migratory fish stocks in their respective regions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UNFSA has played an important role in improving the conservation and management of straddling fish stocks and highly migratory fish stocks. However, there are still a number of challenges that need to be addressed. These include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Overfishing:&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;overfishing&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite these challenges, UNFSA remains an essential tool for the conservation and management of straddling fish stocks and highly migratory fish stocks. States must continue to work together to implement the provisions of UNFSA and to address the challenges that lie ahead.&lt;/p&gt;
