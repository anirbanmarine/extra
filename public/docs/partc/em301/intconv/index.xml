      <description>
        
        
        &lt;p&gt;Agenda 21 is a comprehensive plan of action to achieve sustainable development. It was adopted by 178 governments at the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED) in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, in 1992. Agenda 21 is a non-binding document, but it has been influential in guiding sustainable development efforts around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Agenda 21 covers a wide range of issues, including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sustainable agriculture and rural development
Conservation of biological diversity
Combating deforestation
Protecting the atmosphere
Managing fragile ecosystems
Promoting sustainable energy use
Managing hazardous wastes
Promoting sustainable human settlements
Agenda 21 also emphasizes the importance of international cooperation and participation of all stakeholders in achieving sustainable development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The UNFCCC Agenda 21 is a subset of Agenda 21 that specifically addresses climate change. It outlines a series of actions that countries can take to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and adapt to the impacts of climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The UNFCCC Agenda 21 includes provisions for:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Developed countries to provide financial and technological assistance to developing countries to help them mitigate and adapt to climate change
All countries to develop national climate change action plans
Countries to cooperate in developing and implementing international climate change policies
The UNFCCC Agenda 21 has been influential in shaping the international response to climate change. It has helped to raise awareness of the issue and has provided a framework for international cooperation on climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Current status of the UNFCCC Agenda 21&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The UNFCCC Agenda 21 is still relevant today. The world is still facing significant challenges in addressing climate change, and the UNFCCC Agenda 21 provides a roadmap for how to address these challenges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Countries are making progress in implementing the UNFCCC Agenda 21, but more needs to be done. Developed countries need to provide more financial and technological assistance to developing countries, and all countries need to do more to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and adapt to the impacts of climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Significance of the UNFCCC Agenda 21&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The UNFCCC Agenda 21 is a significant document because it provides a comprehensive framework for addressing climate change. It is also significant because it was adopted by consensus by all UNFCCC member states, which shows that there is a strong international commitment to addressing climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The UNFCCC Agenda 21 has been influential in shaping the international response to climate change. It has helped to raise awareness of the issue and has provided a framework for international cooperation on climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The UNFCCC Agenda 21 is still relevant today, and countries need to continue to implement its provisions in order to address the challenges of climate change.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Kyoto Protocol-UNFCCC (UNFCCC,Kyoto,1997)</title>
      <link>https://www.anirbanmarine.in/docs/partc/em301/intconv/kyotoproto/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>
        
        
        &lt;p&gt;The Kyoto Protocol is an international treaty that was adopted in 1997 at the Third Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in Kyoto, Japan. It entered into force in 2005 and has been ratified by 192 countries, including India.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Kyoto Protocol is the first international treaty to set binding targets for the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. It commits developed countries to reduce their emissions by an average of 5.2% below 1990 levels by the first commitment period, 2008-2012.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Kyoto Protocol includes a number of mechanisms to help countries achieve their emissions targets, including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Emissions trading: Countries can trade emissions permits with each other, so that countries that can reduce their emissions more cheaply can sell permits to countries that find it more difficult or expensive to reduce their emissions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Joint implementation: Countries can work together to implement projects that reduce emissions in other countries.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Clean development mechanism: Developed countries can invest in projects that reduce emissions in developing countries, and then count the emissions reductions towards their own targets.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Kyoto Protocol has played an important role in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and promoting international cooperation on climate change. However, it has also been criticized for not being ambitious enough and for not including all major emitters, such as the United States.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some of the key achievements of the Kyoto Protocol:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Kyoto Protocol has helped to raise awareness of the importance of reducing greenhouse gas emissions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Kyoto Protocol has established a global framework for international cooperation on climate change.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Kyoto Protocol has promoted the development of new technologies and markets for clean energy and energy efficiency.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Kyoto Protocol has helped to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from developed countries.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Kyoto Protocol is an important tool for addressing climate change. However, it is important to note that the first commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol ended in 2012 and that a new agreement, the Paris Agreement, was adopted in 2015. The Paris Agreement sets out a new framework for international cooperation on climate change, with the goal of limiting the global temperature rise to well below 2 degrees Celsius, preferably to 1.5 degrees Celsius, compared to pre-industrial levels.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <description>
        
        
        &lt;p&gt;The Regional Seas Programme (RSP) is a global partnership of 14 Regional Seas Conventions and Action Plans (RSCAPs) that work to protect and manage the marine and coastal environment. The RSP is coordinated by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and is funded by a variety of sources, including governments, international organizations, and the private sector.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The RSP was launched in 1974 at the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment in Stockholm. The first RSCAP was established in the Mediterranean Sea in 1976, and since then, RSCAPs have been established in all major ocean regions around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The RSP takes an ecosystem-based approach to marine and coastal management. This means that it takes into account the interconnectedness of all components of the marine and coastal environment, including humans. The RSP works to protect and manage the marine and coastal environment through a variety of activities, including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Developing and implementing regional action plans to address specific marine and coastal environmental problems
Providing technical assistance and capacity building to developing countries
Promoting public awareness and education about marine and coastal environmental issues
Facilitating cooperation and coordination between different stakeholders
The RSP has played a significant role in protecting and managing the marine and coastal environment. It has helped to reduce pollution, protect biodiversity, and promote sustainable development in coastal communities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Paris 2015, the RSP was recognized as an important tool for implementing the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The SDGs are a set of 17 goals adopted by all United Nations Member States in 2015 as a blueprint to achieve a better and more sustainable future for all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The RSP is particularly relevant to the following SDGs:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SDG 6: Ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all
SDG 14: Conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources for sustainable development
SDG 15: Protect, restore and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, and halt and reverse land degradation and halt biodiversity loss
The RSP is committed to working with all stakeholders to implement the SDGs and achieve a more sustainable future for the marine and coastal environment.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;##Rio+10&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 2002 World Summit on Sustainable Development (WSSD), also known as Rio+10, was held in Johannesburg, South Africa, from 26 August to 4 September 2002. It was a follow-up to the 1992 Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Rio+10 Summit was attended by over 100 heads of state and government, as well as representatives from civil society and the private sector. It focused on the implementation of the outcomes of the 1992 Earth Summit, and on identifying new challenges and opportunities for sustainable development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Rio+10 Summit produced a number of outcomes, including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Johannesburg Declaration on Sustainable Development, which reaffirmed the commitment of world leaders to sustainable development and set out a number of goals and targets to be achieved by 2015.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Plan of Implementation, which provided a detailed blueprint for implementing the Johannesburg Declaration.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Type II Partnerships, which were voluntary agreements between governments, businesses, and civil society organizations to work together on specific sustainable development projects.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Rio+10 Summit was a significant event in the history of sustainable development. It helped to raise awareness of the importance of sustainable development and to mobilize global action on the issue. However, it is important to note that many of the goals and targets set at the Rio+10 Summit were not achieved, and that the world still faces a number of challenges in achieving sustainable development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;##Rio+20&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 2012 United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development (UNCSD), also known as Rio+20, was held in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, from 20 to 22 June 2012. It was a follow-up to the 1992 Earth Summit and the 2002 Rio+10 Summit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Rio+20 Conference was attended by over 100 heads of state and government, as well as representatives from civil society and the private sector. It focused on the following three themes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Green economy in the context of sustainable development and poverty eradication.
Institutional framework for sustainable development.
The new challenges of sustainable development.
The Rio+20 Conference produced a number of outcomes, including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Future We Want, an outcome document that reaffirmed the commitment of world leaders to sustainable development and set out a number of goals and targets to be achieved.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The 10-Year Framework of Programmes on Sustainable Consumption and Production Patterns (10YFP), which provided a framework for international cooperation on sustainable consumption and production.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Intergovernmental Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES), an independent intergovernmental body to assess the state of biodiversity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Rio+20 Conference was a significant event in the history of sustainable development. It helped to renew the commitment of world leaders to sustainable development and to lay the foundation for a new era of sustainable development. However, it is important to note that many of the goals and targets set at the Rio+20 Conference have not yet been achieved, and that the world still faces a number of challenges in achieving sustainable development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Legacy of Rio+10 and Rio+20&lt;span class=&#34;hx-absolute -hx-mt-20&#34; id=&#34;legacy-of-rio10-and-rio20&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#legacy-of-rio10-and-rio20&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Rio+10 and Rio+20 Summits were important events in the history of sustainable development. They helped to raise awareness of the importance of sustainable development, to mobilize global action on the issue, and to lay the foundation for a new era of sustainable development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, it is important to note that many of the goals and targets set at the Rio+10 and Rio+20 Summits have not yet been achieved. The world still faces a number of challenges in achieving sustainable development, including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Poverty and inequality&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Climate change&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Biodiversity loss&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pollution&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Resource scarcity
Despite these challenges, there is also a growing awareness of the importance of sustainable development and a growing commitment to achieving it. The Rio+10 and Rio+20 Summits played an important role in promoting sustainable development, and their legacy continues to inspire people around the world to work towards a more sustainable future.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>The Commission on Sustainable Development (CSD,Rio,1992)</title>
      <link>https://www.anirbanmarine.in/docs/partc/em301/intconv/csd1992/</link>

      <description>
        
        
        &lt;p&gt;The Commission on Sustainable Development (CSD) was a functional commission of the United Nations Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) that was established in 1992 following the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro. The CSD was tasked with reviewing the implementation of Agenda 21, the global plan for sustainable development that was adopted at the Earth Summit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Global Environment Facility (GEF) is an international financial institution that was established in 1992 to provide &amp;gt;funding for projects that address global environmental problems. The GEF is one of the financial mechanisms of the CSD, &amp;gt;and it plays an important role in supporting the implementation of Agenda 21.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The GEF provides funding for projects in a number of areas, including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Climate change&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Biodiversity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;International waters&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Land degradation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Chemicals and waste&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Persistent organic pollutants (POPs)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The GEF works with a variety of partners, including governments, civil society organizations, and the private sector, to implement its projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CSD was abolished in 2013 and its functions were transferred to the High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF). The HLPF is the global forum for reviewing the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The GEF continues to play an important role in supporting the implementation of the SDGs. It is the largest provider of grants to developing countries for environmental projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some examples of how the GEF has supported the implementation of Agenda 21:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The GEF has provided funding for projects to protect and restore forests, which play an important role in mitigating climate change and conserving biodiversity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The GEF has provided funding for projects to improve water quality and management, which is essential for human health and sustainable development.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The GEF has provided funding for projects to reduce pollution and protect the environment from hazardous chemicals and waste.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The GEF is a key partner in the global effort to achieve sustainable development. It plays an important role in supporting the implementation of Agenda 21 and the SDGs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>The Intergovernmental Conference on biological diversity beyond national jurisdiction (BBNJ,2023)</title>
      <link>https://www.anirbanmarine.in/docs/partc/em301/intconv/bbnj/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://www.anirbanmarine.in/docs/partc/em301/intconv/bbnj/</guid>
      <description>
        
        
        &lt;p&gt;The Intergovernmental Conference on biological diversity beyond national jurisdiction (BBNJ) concluded on June 19, 2023, with the adoption of a landmark agreement to conserve and sustainably use marine biodiversity in areas beyond national jurisdiction (ABNJ). The agreement, which was adopted by consensus by the 193 member states of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), is the first comprehensive international treaty to address marine biodiversity in ABNJ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The BBNJ agreement covers a wide range of issues, including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Marine protected areas (MPAs): The agreement establishes a process for establishing and managing MPAs in ABNJ, including large-scale MPAs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Environmental impact assessments (EIAs): The agreement requires EIAs to be conducted for all activities that have the potential to significantly impact marine biodiversity in ABNJ.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Capacity building and technology transfer: The agreement includes provisions to help developing countries build their capacity to implement the agreement and to gain access to relevant technologies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The BBNJ agreement is a significant achievement for the conservation of marine biodiversity. It is estimated that ABNJ accounts for over half of the Earth&amp;rsquo;s surface and is home to a vast array of marine life, much of which is still unknown to science. The agreement will help to protect this biodiversity from the growing threats of climate change, overfishing, and pollution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Current status of the BBNJ agreement&lt;span class=&#34;hx-absolute -hx-mt-20&#34; id=&#34;current-status-of-the-bbnj-agreement&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#current-status-of-the-bbnj-agreement&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of October 1, 2023, the BBNJ agreement has been signed by 92 countries and regional economic integration organizations. However, it has not yet been ratified by any country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Significance of the BBNJ agreement&lt;span class=&#34;hx-absolute -hx-mt-20&#34; id=&#34;significance-of-the-bbnj-agreement&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#significance-of-the-bbnj-agreement&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The BBNJ agreement is a significant achievement for the conservation of marine biodiversity. It is the first comprehensive international treaty to address marine biodiversity in ABNJ, which covers over half of the Earth&amp;rsquo;s surface. The agreement will help to protect this biodiversity from the growing threats of climate change, overfishing, and pollution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The BBNJ agreement is also significant because it was adopted by consensus by the 193 member states of UNCLOS. This shows that there is a strong international commitment to conserving marine biodiversity in ABNJ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Next steps&lt;span class=&#34;hx-absolute -hx-mt-20&#34; id=&#34;next-steps&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#next-steps&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next step for the BBNJ agreement is for countries to ratify it. Once 30 countries have ratified the agreement, it will enter into force.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Countries are encouraged to ratify the BBNJ agreement as soon as possible to ensure that its benefits can be realized as soon as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>
        
        
        &lt;p&gt;The London Convention on the Prevention of Marine Pollution by Dumping of Wastes and Other Matter (LC 1972) is a global treaty adopted in 1972 to protect the marine environment from human activities, including the dumping of wastes. The Convention entered into force in 1975 and currently has 87 Contracting Parties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The London Convention prohibits the dumping of certain hazardous materials, such as organohalogen compounds, mercury, cadmium, persistent plastics, and radioactive wastes. It also requires a prior special permit for the dumping of certain other materials, such as industrial wastes and dredged material.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1996, the London Protocol was adopted to further modernize the Convention and, eventually, replace it. The Protocol prohibits all dumping, except for possibly acceptable wastes on the so-called &amp;ldquo;reverse list&amp;rdquo;. The London Protocol entered into force in 2006 and currently has 52 Contracting Parties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The London Convention and Protocol play an important role in protecting the marine environment from pollution caused by dumping. By prohibiting or regulating the dumping of certain wastes, the Conventions help to ensure that the oceans remain clean and healthy for future generations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some of the key achievements of the London Convention and Protocol:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The dumping of radioactive wastes at sea has been banned since 1993.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The dumping of industrial wastes at sea was phased out by 1995.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The incineration of wastes at sea has been banned since 1994.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The dumping of persistent plastics at sea has been prohibited since 2010.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The London Convention and Protocol have helped to reduce the amount of marine debris, such as plastic bags and bottles, in the oceans.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Conventions have also helped to improve the quality of seawater and seabed sediments in many parts of the world.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The London Convention and Protocol are important tools for protecting the marine environment from pollution caused by dumping. By working together, the Contracting Parties to the Conventions can help to ensure that the oceans remain clean and healthy for all.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED),1992</title>
      <link>https://www.anirbanmarine.in/docs/partc/em301/intconv/unced/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>
        
        
        &lt;p&gt;The United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED), also known as the Earth Summit, was a major United Nations conference held in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, from June 3 to 14, 1992. It was the largest gathering of world leaders as of 1992, with 117 heads of state and representatives of 178 nations in all attending.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Earth Summit was convened in recognition of the growing interdependence of the environment and development. It was a landmark event in the history of international environmental cooperation, and it produced a number of important agreements, including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Rio Declaration on Environment and Development, which sets out 27 principles for sustainable development, including the principle that &amp;ldquo;human beings are at the centre of concerns for sustainable development.&amp;rdquo;
The Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), which is the main international treaty for addressing climate change.
The Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), which is the main international treaty for addressing the loss of biodiversity.
Agenda 21, a comprehensive plan for sustainable development that covers a wide range of issues, including poverty, hunger, health, education, and environmental protection.
The Earth Summit was a major step forward in international environmental cooperation, but it is important to note that the agreements it produced are not legally binding. This means that countries are not obligated to implement them, but they do provide a framework for international action on sustainable development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Earth Summit also had a significant impact on public awareness of environmental issues. It helped to put sustainable development on the global agenda and to inspire people around the world to take action to protect the environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 30th anniversary of the Earth Summit will be celebrated in 2022. This is an opportunity to reflect on the progress that has been made in the past 30 years and to identify the challenges that remain. It is also an opportunity to renew our commitment to sustainable development and to build a better future for all.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD,Rio,1992) </title>
      <link>https://www.anirbanmarine.in/docs/partc/em301/intconv/unconvbiodiversity/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>
        
        
        &lt;p&gt;The United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) is an international treaty that aims to promote sustainable development. It was adopted at the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro in 1992 and has been ratified by 196 countries, including India.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CBD has three main objectives:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The conservation of biological diversity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The sustainable use of its components.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The fair and equitable sharing of the benefits arising from the use of genetic resources.
The CBD is a comprehensive treaty that covers all aspects of biological diversity, from ecosystems to species to genes. It also covers biotechnology and the fair and equitable sharing of benefits from the use of genetic resources.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CBD is implemented through a number of mechanisms, including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;National Biodiversity Strategies and Action Plans (NBSAPs): NBSAPs are national plans that outline how each country will implement the CBD.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Conference of the Parties (COP): The COP is the supreme decision-making body of the CBD. It meets every two years to review the implementation of the Convention and to make decisions on new initiatives.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Subsidiary Body on Scientific, Technical and Technological Advice (SBSTTA): SBSTTA is a scientific advisory body that provides advice to the COP on scientific, technical, and technological matters related to the CBD.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Subsidiary Body on Implementation (SBI): SBI is an implementation advisory body that provides advice to the COP on the implementation of the CBD.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The CBD has played an important role in promoting the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity around the world. However, there are still a number of challenges that need to be addressed, such as the loss of biodiversity due to habitat loss, climate change, and invasive species.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some of the key achievements of the CBD:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The CBD has helped to raise awareness of the importance of biological diversity and the need to protect it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The CBD has promoted the development of national biodiversity strategies and action plans, which have helped to guide countries in their efforts to conserve and sustainably use biological diversity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The CBD has established a number of mechanisms for international cooperation on biological diversity, such as the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) and the Clearing-House Mechanism.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The CBD has helped to promote the fair and equitable sharing of benefits from the use of genetic resources.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The CBD is an important tool for protecting biological diversity and promoting sustainable development. It is essential that all parties continue to work together to implement the Convention effectively.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC,Rio,1992)</title>
      <link>https://www.anirbanmarine.in/docs/partc/em301/intconv/unfccc/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>
        
        
        &lt;p&gt;The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) is an international treaty that was adopted in 1992 at the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. It entered into force in 1994 and has been ratified by 198 countries, including India.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The UNFCCC is a landmark agreement that sets out the global framework for addressing climate change. It recognizes that climate change is a common concern of humankind and that all countries have a responsibility to address it. However, it also acknowledges that countries have different capabilities and responsibilities in addressing climate change, and that developed countries should take the lead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The UNFCCC has two main objectives:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To stabilize greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To achieve this objective within a time-frame sufficient to allow ecosystems to adapt naturally to climate change, to ensure that food production is not threatened and to enable economic development to proceed in a sustainable manner.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The UNFCCC is implemented through a number of mechanisms, including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;National communications: Parties to the UNFCCC are required to submit national communications on a regular basis. These communications provide information on greenhouse gas emissions, mitigation and adaptation measures, and financial and technological needs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Conference of the Parties (COP): The COP is the supreme decision-making body of the UNFCCC. It meets every year to review the implementation of the Convention and to make decisions on new initiatives.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Subsidiary Body on Scientific, Technical and Technological Advice (SBSTA): SBSTA is a scientific advisory body that provides advice to the COP on scientific, technical, and technological matters related to the UNFCCC.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Subsidiary Body on Implementation (SBI): SBI is an implementation advisory body that provides advice to the COP on the implementation of the UNFCCC.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The UNFCCC has played an important role in promoting international cooperation on climate change. However, there are still a number of challenges that need to be addressed, such as reducing greenhouse gas emissions to limit the global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius, and providing financial and technological support to developing countries to help them adapt to the impacts of climate change.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some of the key achievements of the UNFCCC:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The UNFCCC has helped to raise awareness of the importance of climate change and the need to address it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The UNFCCC has established a global framework for international cooperation on climate change.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The UNFCCC has promoted the development of national climate change policies and plans.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The UNFCCC has helped to mobilize financial and technological resources to support developing countries in their efforts to mitigate and adapt to climate change.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The UNFCCC is an important tool for addressing climate change. It is essential that all parties continue to work together to implement the Convention effectively.&lt;/li&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;The United Nations Conference on the Human Environment, also known as the Stockholm Conference, was held in Stockholm, Sweden, from June 5-16, 1972. It was the first major international conference to address environmental issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The conference was attended by representatives from 113 countries, and resulted in the adoption of the Stockholm Declaration, an Action Plan for the Human Environment, and several resolutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Stockholm Declaration is a landmark document in environmental law. It contains 26 principles that outline the rights and responsibilities of states in protecting the environment. Some of the key principles of the Stockholm Declaration include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Man has the fundamental right to freedom, equality and adequate conditions of life, in an environment of a quality that permits a life of dignity and well-being.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;States have, in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations and the principles of international law, the sovereign right to exploit their own resources pursuant to their own environmental policies, and the responsibility to ensure that activities within their jurisdiction or control do not cause damage to the environment of other States or of areas beyond the limits of national jurisdiction.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The natural resources of the earth, including air, water, land, flora and fauna and especially representative samples of natural ecosystems, must be safeguarded for the benefit of present and future generations through careful planning or management, as appropriate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Action Plan for the Human Environment is a comprehensive document that sets out a series of recommendations for addressing environmental problems at the national and international levels. The plan includes recommendations on a wide range of issues, including pollution control, natural resource management, and environmental education.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Stockholm Conference was a watershed moment in the global environmental movement. It helped to raise awareness of environmental problems and to promote international cooperation in addressing them. The principles and recommendations of the Stockholm Conference continue to guide environmental policy and law around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Significance of the United Nations Convention on Human Environment, 1972&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;The United Nations Convention on Human Environment, 1972, was a landmark event in the history of environmental protection. It was the first major international conference to address environmental issues, and it resulted in the adoption of a number of important documents, including the Stockholm Declaration and the Action Plan for the Human Environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Stockholm Declaration is a landmark document in environmental law. It contains 26 principles that outline the rights and responsibilities of states in protecting the environment. The principles of the Stockholm Declaration have been incorporated into many other international environmental agreements and national environmental laws.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Action Plan for the Human Environment is a comprehensive document that sets out a series of recommendations for addressing environmental problems at the national and international levels. The plan includes recommendations on a wide range of issues, including pollution control, natural resource management, and environmental education.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United Nations Convention on Human Environment, 1972, was a watershed moment in the global environmental movement. It helped to lay the foundation for the development of international environmental law and policy. The conference also helped to raise awareness of environmental problems and to promote international cooperation in addressing them.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;h2&gt;What is it?&lt;span class=&#34;hx-absolute -hx-mt-20&#34; id=&#34;what-is-it&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#what-is-it&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Basel Convention on the Control of Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes and their Disposal, 1989 is an international treaty that aims to protect human health and the environment against the adverse effects of hazardous wastes. &lt;strong&gt;It was adopted on 22 March 1989 and entered into force on 5 May 1992. As of October 1, 2023, it has 189 parties.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Convention covers a wide range of wastes, including toxic, poisonous, explosive, corrosive, flammable, ecotoxic, and infectious wastes. It also covers two types of wastes defined as &amp;ldquo;other wastes&amp;rdquo; - household waste and incinerator ash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Convention regulates the transboundary movement of hazardous wastes and other wastes and obliges its parties to ensure that such wastes are managed and disposed of in an environmentally sound manner. Parties have an obligation to minimize the quantities that are transported, to treat and dispose of wastes as close as possible to their place of generation, and to prevent or minimize the generation of wastes at source.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Convention also prohibits the export of hazardous wastes from developed countries to developing countries. This is known as the &amp;ldquo;ban amendment&amp;rdquo; and it was adopted in 1995.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How is it implemented?&lt;span class=&#34;hx-absolute -hx-mt-20&#34; id=&#34;how-is-it-implemented&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#how-is-it-implemented&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Basel Convention is implemented through a system of prior informed consent (PIC), which requires parties to notify each other and obtain consent before shipping hazardous wastes and other wastes across borders. The Convention also establishes a number of other measures to control the transboundary movement of hazardous wastes, including a requirement for packaging, labeling, and transport in accordance with international standards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Basel Convention has played an important role in reducing the transboundary movement of hazardous wastes and protecting human health and the environment. However, there are still a number of challenges that need to be addressed, such as the illegal trafficking of hazardous wastes and the management of hazardous wastes in developing countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What are the key achievements?&lt;span class=&#34;hx-absolute -hx-mt-20&#34; id=&#34;what-are-the-key-achievements&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#what-are-the-key-achievements&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here are some of the key achievements of the Basel Convention:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The ban on the export of hazardous wastes from developed countries to developing countries has helped to protect developing countries from the dumping of hazardous wastes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The PIC system has helped to ensure that parties are aware of and have a say in the transboundary movement of hazardous wastes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Convention has promoted the development of environmentally sound waste management practices in developing countries.
The Basel Convention is an important tool for protecting human health and the environment from the adverse effects of hazardous wastes. It is essential that all parties continue to work together to implement the Convention effectively.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Overview&lt;span class=&#34;hx-absolute -hx-mt-20&#34; id=&#34;overview&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#overview&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Basel Convention on the Control of Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes and their Disposal was adopted on 22 March 1989 by the Conference of Plenipotentiaries in Basel, Switzerland, in response to a public outcry following the discovery, in the 1980s, in Africa and other parts of the developing world of deposits of toxic wastes imported from abroad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Awakening environmental awareness and corresponding tightening of environmental regulations in the industrialized world in the 1970s and 1980s had led to increasing public resistance to the disposal of hazardous wastes – in accordance with what became known as the NIMBY (Not In My Back Yard) syndrome – and to an escalation of disposal costs. This in turn led some operators to seek cheap disposal options for hazardous wastes in Eastern Europe and the developing world, where environmental awareness was much less developed and regulations and enforcement mechanisms were lacking. It was against this background that the Basel Convention was negotiated in the late 1980s, and its thrust at the time of its adoption was to combat the “toxic trade”, as it was termed. The Convention entered into force in 1992.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;span class=&#34;hx-absolute -hx-mt-20&#34; id=&#34;objective&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#objective&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The overarching objective of the Basel Convention is to protect human health and the environment against the adverse effects of hazardous wastes. Its scope of application covers a wide range of wastes defined as “hazardous wastes” based on their origin and/or composition and their characteristics, as well as two types of wastes defined as “other wastes” - household waste and incinerator ash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Aims and provisions&lt;span class=&#34;hx-absolute -hx-mt-20&#34; id=&#34;aims-and-provisions&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#aims-and-provisions&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The provisions of the Convention center around the following principal aims:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the reduction of hazardous waste generation and the promotion of environmentally sound management of hazardous wastes, wherever the place of disposal;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the restriction of transboundary movements of hazardous wastes except where it is perceived to be in accordance with the principles of environmentally sound management; and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a regulatory system applying to cases where transboundary movements are permissible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first aim is addressed through a number of general provisions requiring States to observe the fundamental principles of environmentally sound waste management (article 4).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A number of prohibitions are designed to attain the second aim: hazardous wastes may not be exported to Antarctica, to a State not party to the Basel Convention, or to a party having banned the import of hazardous wastes (article 4).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parties may, however, enter into bilateral or multilateral agreements on hazardous waste management with other parties or with non-parties, provided that such agreements are “no less environmentally sound” than the Basel Convention (article 11).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In all cases where transboundary movement is not, in principle, prohibited, it may take place only if it represents an environmentally sound solution, if the principles of environmentally sound management and non-discrimination are observed and if it is carried out in accordance with the Convention’s regulatory system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The regulatory system is the cornerstone of the Basel Convention as originally adopted. Based on the concept of prior informed consent, it requires that, before an export may take place, the authorities of the State of export notify the authorities of the prospective States of import and transit, providing them with detailed information on the intended movement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The movement may only proceed if and when all States concerned have given their written consent (articles 6 and 7).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Basel Convention also provides for cooperation between parties, ranging from exchange of information on issues relevant to the implementation of the Convention to technical assistance, particularly to developing countries (articles 10 and 13).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Secretariat is required to facilitate and support this cooperation, acting as a clearing-house (article 16).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the event of a transboundary movement of hazardous wastes having been carried out illegally, i.e. in contravention of the provisions of articles 6 and 7, or cannot be completed as foreseen, the Convention attributes responsibility to one or more of the States involved, and imposes the duty to ensure safe disposal, either by re-import into the State of generation or otherwise (articles 8 and 9).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Convention also provides for the establishment of regional or sub-regional centres for training and technology transfers regarding the management of hazardous wastes and other wastes and the minimization of their generation to cater to the specific needs of different regions and subregions (article 14). Fourteen such centres have been established. They carry out training and capacity building activities in the regions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since its adoption, the Basel Convention has seen a number of significant developments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Amendment to the Convention on the Con­trol of Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes and their Disposal (“the Ban Amendment”) was adopted by the third meeting of the Conference of the Parties (COP) in 1995. The Ban Amendment provides for the prohibition of ex­ports of all hazardous wastes covered by the Convention that are intended for final disposal, reuse, recycling and recovery from countries listed in annex VII to the Convention (Parties and other States which are members of the OECD, EC, Liechtenstein) to all oth­er countries. As at 1 January 2011, the Ban Amendment has not yet entered into force. The challenge of protecting vulnerable countries from unwanted hazardous waste imports, while not precluding the import of wastes considered valuable secondary raw materials to countries in a position to manage them in an environmentally sound manner has therefore gained importance. Informal discussions were initiated at COP 9 in 2008 to identify a way to enable the entry into force of the Ban Amendment while addressing the concerns and needs of all countries in this context.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Annexes VIII and IX to the Convention, which provide further elaboration as to the wastes regulated by the Convention as listed in Annexes I and III were adopted by COP 4 in 1998.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Basel Protocol on Liability and Compensation for Damage resulting from Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes and their Disposal was adopted by COP 5 in 1999. The Basel Protocol regulates civil liability for damage resulting from the transboundary movement of hazardous wastes and other wastes, including incidents occurring as a result of illegal traffic. As at 1 January 2011, the Basel Protocol has not yet entered into force. Delegates at COP 5 also agreed on an interim arrangement to cover emergency situations until the Protocol en­ters into force. COP 6 in 2002 approved the Interim Guidelines for the Implementa­tion of decision V/32 on the Enlargement of the scope of the Technical Cooperation Trust Fund.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Committee for Administering the Mechanism for Promoting Implementation and Compliance was established at COP 6 in Geneva in 2002. The objective of this mechanism is to assist parties to comply with their obligations under the Convention and to facilitate, promote, monitor and aim to secure the implementation of, and compliance with, the obligations under the Convention. The mechanism is non-confrontational, transparent, cost-effective and preventive in nature, simple, flexible, non-binding and oriented in the direction of helping parties to implement the provisions of the Basel Convention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the most important contributions of the Basel Convention over the past 20 years is the elaboration of a significant number of policy instruments with non-binding character. Within the framework of the Convention, a large body of technical guidelines on the management of specific waste streams has been developed by technical government expert groups and approved by the COP. These non-binding instruments have been designed for the use of Governments at all levels, as well as other stakeholders, to provide practical guidance and thus facilitate the management of the relevant waste streams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2002, COP 6 adopted the Strategic Plan for the implementation of the Basel Convention for the period 2002 to 2010, to assist developing countries and countries with economies in transition in implementing the provisions of the Convention. Numerous national and regional capacity building and training projects have since been implemented under the umbrella of the Strategic Plan, with the assistance of the Secretariat and the Basel Convention Regional Centres. COP 10 in October 2011 is expected to adopt a new strategic framework for the period 2011 to 2021, defining the fundamental aims and priorities of the Convention for the relevant decade while taking into account changes that have occurred since its adoption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;COP 6 also established a partnership programme with business and industry. Under this programme, two public-private partnerships have thus far been successfully launched, both with the objective of developing specific technical guidelines – to be used by the relevant industry and authorities for the management of end-of-life electronic devices and electronic waste – and initiating relevant pilot projects at country level, including in companies. Between 2003 and 2008, the Mobile Phone Partnership Initiative (MPPI) developed guidelines for every stage of the management of end-of-life mobile phones, which are being used in relevant facilities. 2008 saw the inception of the Partnership for Action on Computing Equipment (PACE) by COP 9. Building on experience gained with the MPPI, PACE is working to increase the environmentally sound management of used and end-of-life computing equipment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bali Declaration on Waste Management for Human Health and Livelihood, adopted by COP 9 in 2008, has affirmed at the political level that waste, if not managed in a safe and environmentally sound manner, may have serious consequences for the environment, human health and sustainable livelihood. The commitment agreed by Ministers in the Bali Declaration to prevent the illegal transboundary movement of hazardous wastes, minimize the generation of hazardous wastes and promote the safe and environmentally sound management of waste within each country has since been supported by other international organizations. Following the UNEP Governing Council / Global Ministerial Environment Forum in 2009, the World Health Assembly in May 2010 and the Human Rights Council in June 2010 also highlighted the link between toxic waste, human health, and the enjoyment of human rights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, the management of hazardous chemicals and wastes has moved up on the international political agenda in the context of environmental governance. This is in no small part due to what has become known as the “synergies” process between the Basel, Rotterdam Convention on the Prior Informed Consent Procedure for Certain Hazardous Chemicals and Pesticides in International Trade and the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants. Several years of deliberations through a Party-led process culminated in the successful simultaneous extraordinary meetings of the Conferences of the Parties to the Basel, Rotterdam and Stockholm conventions (ExCOPs) took place in Bali from 22 to 24 February 2010. A “first” in the history of international treaties and the highlight of the synergies process thus far, the ExCOPs gave directions for countries to implement the three conventions in a more holistic and coordinated way. The conventions have joined forces to better address the challenge of environmentally sound management of hazardous substances at different stages of their life cycle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Basel Convention celebrated its 20th anniversary in 2009 – an event commemorated in November 2009 in Basel (Switzerland). On this occasion, Kenya, Indonesia, and Colombia, the past, present and future Presidents of the COP, together with Switzerland as the host of the Diplomatic Conference in 1989, launched the Basel Waste Solutions Circle, an initiative showcasing projects at all levels that contribute in a concrete manner to the implementation of the Bali Declaration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the past 20 years, the Basel Convention has had ample occasion to adjust to new global developments and needs with regards to waste management over the years, and has risen to these challenges. With the added benefit of closer cooperation with the Rotterdam and Stockholm conventions, the Convention now has the potential to start considering wastes more in a life cycle context. This will make it possible to embrace new ways of thinking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Basel Convention plays a decisive role in achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) - poverty reduction, reducing child mortality, improving maternal health, ensure environmental sustainability. Waste minimization undoubtedly leads us to achieving the MDGs. In addition, state-of-the art recycling in accordance with agreed standards could create business opportunities and safe jobs; a higher yield of secondary raw materials; conservation of precious resources through extraction and re-use rather than primary mining; and better protection of the air, soil, water and thus human health. Realizing this potential might also lessen the incentives for illegal recycling operations, through providing legal, safe and economically rewarding alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;h2&gt;The Law of the Sea for All Nations.&lt;span class=&#34;hx-absolute -hx-mt-20&#34; id=&#34;the-law-of-the-sea-for-all-nations&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#the-law-of-the-sea-for-all-nations&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;UNlimits.jpg&#34; title=&#34;limits&#34; alt=&#34;limits&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; /&gt;
    &lt;figcaption&gt;limits&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The States Parties to this Convention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prompted by the desire to settle, in a spirit of mutual understanding and
cooperation, all issues relating to the law of the sea and aware of the historic
significance of this Convention as an important contribution to the
maintenance of peace, justice and progress for all peoples of the world,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Noting that developments since the United Nations Conferences on the
Law of the Sea held at Geneva in 1958 and 1960 have accentuated the need
for a new and generally acceptable Convention on the law of the sea,
Conscious that the problems of ocean space are closely interrelated and
need to be considered as a whole,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recognizing the desirability of establishing through this Convention,
with due regard for the sovereignty of all States, a legal order for the seas and
oceans which will facilitate international communication, and will promote
the peaceful uses of the seas and oceans, the equitable and efficient utilization
of their resources, the conservation of their living resources, and the study,
protection and preservation of the marine environment,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bearing in mind that the achievement of these goals will contribute to
the realization of a just and equitable international economic order which
takes into account the interests and needs of mankind as a whole and, in
particular, the special interests and needs of developing countries, whether
coastal or land-locked,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Desiring by this Convention to develop the principles embodied in
resolution 2749 (XXV) of 17 December 1970 in which the General Assembly
of the United Nations solemnly declared inter alia that the area of the seabed
and ocean floor and the subsoil thereof, beyond the limits of national
jurisdiction, as well as its resources, are the common heritage of mankind, the
exploration and exploitation of which shall be carried out for the benefit of
mankind as a whole, irrespective of the geographical location of States,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Believing that the codification and progressive development of the law
of the sea achieved in this Convention will contribute to the strengthening of
peace, security, cooperation and friendly relations among all nations in
conformity with the principles of justice and equal rights and will promote the
economic and social advancement of all peoples of the world, in accordance
with the Purposes and Principles of the United Nations as set forth in the
Charter,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Affirming that matters not regulated by this Convention continue to be
governed by the rules and principles of general international law,&lt;/p&gt;
