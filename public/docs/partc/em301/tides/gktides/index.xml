        &lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modern tidal theory is based on the dynamic theory of tides, which was developed in the 18th and 19th centuries. The dynamic theory of tides takes into account the effects of the Earth&amp;rsquo;s rotation, the shape of the ocean basins, and the friction between the water and the seabed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modern tidal theory is used to predict the tides at any location on Earth. To do this, scientists use complex computer models that take into account all of the factors that influence the tides. These models are used to create tide tables, which show the predicted times and heights of the tides for each day of the year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modern tidal theory is also used to study the long-term effects of climate change on the tides. For example, scientists are using tidal models to predict how the tides will change as sea levels rise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some of the key features of modern tidal theory:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It takes into account the effects of the Earth&amp;rsquo;s rotation.&lt;/strong&gt; The Earth&amp;rsquo;s rotation causes the tides to lag behind the moon and the sun. This lag is responsible for the semi-diurnal tides, which are the two high tides and two low tides per day.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It takes into account the shape of the ocean basins.&lt;/strong&gt; The shape of the ocean basins can affect the tides in a number of ways. For example, the tides in a funnel-shaped basin will be higher than the tides in a rectangular basin.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It takes into account the friction between the water and the seabed.&lt;/strong&gt; Friction between the water and the seabed slows down the tides and makes them less predictable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modern tidal theory is a complex and sophisticated theory that is used to predict the tides and to study the long-term effects of climate change on the tides.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Here are some examples of how modern tidal theory is used:&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;here-are-some-examples-of-how-modern-tidal-theory-is-used&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tide prediction:&lt;/strong&gt; Modern tidal theory is used to predict the tides at any location on Earth. This information is used by mariners, fishermen, and other people who need to know when the tides will be high and low.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Coastal engineering:&lt;/strong&gt; Modern tidal theory is used by coastal engineers to design structures that can withstand the tides. For example, tidal models are used to design seawalls and breakwaters.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Climate change research:&lt;/strong&gt; Modern tidal theory is used by climate scientists to study the long-term effects of climate change on the tides. For example, tidal models are used to predict how the tides will change as sea levels rise.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modern tidal theory is an essential tool for understanding and predicting the tides. It is used by a variety of people and organizations for a variety of purposes.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Equilibrium Tide</title>
      <link>https://anirbanmarine.in/docs/partc/em301/tides/gktides/equitide/</link>

        &lt;h2&gt;What is the Equilibrium Tide?&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;what-is-the-equilibrium-tide&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#what-is-the-equilibrium-tide&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The equilibrium tide is the hypothetical tide that would be produced by the lunar and solar tidal forces if the Earth were covered with water to such a depth that the response to these forces is instantaneous. In this idealized case, the Earth would be a perfectly spherical water body with no continents or other obstructions. The equilibrium tide would be a standing wave, with two high tides and two low tides per day. The high tides would be located directly below the moon and on the opposite side of the Earth from the moon, and the low tides would be located between the high tides.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The equilibrium tide is a useful concept for understanding the basic principles of tidal forces, but it is not a realistic representation of the actual tides. The actual tides are influenced by a variety of factors, including the continents, the ocean basins, and the Earth&amp;rsquo;s rotation. These factors can cause the actual tides to differ significantly from the equilibrium tide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Here are some of the factors that influence the actual tides:&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;here-are-some-of-the-factors-that-influence-the-actual-tides&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#here-are-some-of-the-factors-that-influence-the-actual-tides&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Continents:&lt;/strong&gt; The continents block the flow of water, which can cause the actual tides to differ from the equilibrium tide. For example, the tides in the Atlantic Ocean are different from the tides in the Pacific Ocean because the Atlantic Ocean is surrounded by continents on three sides.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ocean basins:&lt;/strong&gt; The shape of the ocean basins can also affect the tides. For example, the tides in the Bay of Fundy are very high because the Bay of Fundy is a funnel-shaped basin.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Earth&amp;rsquo;s rotation:&lt;/strong&gt; The Earth&amp;rsquo;s rotation also affects the tides. The Earth&amp;rsquo;s rotation causes the tides to lag behind the moon and the sun. This lag is responsible for the semi-diurnal tides, which are the two high tides and two low tides per day.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The actual tides are a complex phenomenon that is influenced by a variety of factors. However, the equilibrium tide is a useful concept for understanding the basic principles of tidal forces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Here is an example of the difference between the equilibrium tide and the actual tide:&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;here-is-an-example-of-the-difference-between-the-equilibrium-tide-and-the-actual-tide&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#here-is-an-example-of-the-difference-between-the-equilibrium-tide-and-the-actual-tide&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The equilibrium tide at the equator would have two high tides and two low tides per day, with the high tides occurring directly below the moon and on the opposite side of the Earth from the moon. However, the actual tides at the equator are diurnal, meaning that there is only one high tide and one low tide per day. This is because the continents block the flow of water and the Earth&amp;rsquo;s rotation causes the tides to lag behind the moon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The equilibrium tide is a useful concept for understanding the basic principles of tidal forces, but it is important to remember that the actual tides are more complex and can vary significantly from the equilibrium tide.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Tide raising forces</title>
      <link>https://anirbanmarine.in/docs/partc/em301/tides/gktides/tideforce/</link>

        &lt;h2&gt;Tidal forces are the gravitational forces that cause the tides.&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;tidal-forces-are-the-gravitational-forces-that-cause-the-tides&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#tidal-forces-are-the-gravitational-forces-that-cause-the-tides&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;They are caused by the gravitational pull of the moon and the sun on the Earth. The moon&amp;rsquo;s gravity has a stronger effect than the sun&amp;rsquo;s gravity because the moon is closer to the Earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tidal forces are differential forces, which means that they pull differently on different parts of the Earth. The part of the Earth that is closest to the moon is pulled more strongly than the part of the Earth that is farthest from the moon. This creates a bulge in the Earth&amp;rsquo;s oceans on the side of the Earth that is closest to the moon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is also a bulge in the Earth&amp;rsquo;s oceans on the opposite side of the Earth from the moon. This is because the centrifugal force created by the Earth&amp;rsquo;s rotation pushes the water away from the center of the Earth on the opposite side of the Earth from the moon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two bulges in the Earth&amp;rsquo;s oceans create the tides. The high tide is located under the two bulges, and the low tide is located between the two bulges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sun also has an effect on the tides, but its effect is weaker than the moon&amp;rsquo;s effect because the sun is farther away from the Earth. When the sun and moon are aligned, their gravitational forces combine to produce spring tides. Spring tides are the highest tides of the month. When the sun and moon are at right angles to each other, their gravitational forces cancel each other out, producing neap tides. Neap tides are the lowest tides of the month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tidal forces also have an effect on the solid Earth. The solid Earth is not as flexible as the oceans, so it does not bulge as much as the oceans. However, the solid Earth does flex slightly, causing the tides.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tidal forces also have an effect on other planets and moons in the solar system. For example, the moon&amp;rsquo;s tidal forces on the Earth cause the Earth to rotate more slowly over time. The Earth&amp;rsquo;s tidal forces on the moon have caused the moon to become tidally locked to the Earth, which means that the same side of the moon always faces the Earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tidal forces are a powerful force in nature. They play an important role in the Earth&amp;rsquo;s oceans, atmosphere, and solid Earth. Tidal forces also have an effect on other planets and moons in the solar system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Here are some additional details about the effects of tidal forces:&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;here-are-some-additional-details-about-the-effects-of-tidal-forces&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#here-are-some-additional-details-about-the-effects-of-tidal-forces&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tidal forces on the oceans:&lt;/strong&gt; Tidal forces cause the oceans to rise and fall twice a day. The height of the tides varies depending on the phase of the moon, the position of the sun relative to the moon, and the local geography.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tidal forces on the solid Earth:&lt;/strong&gt; Tidal forces cause the solid Earth to flex slightly, causing the tides. The solid Earth is not as flexible as the oceans, so the tides in the solid Earth are much smaller than the tides in the oceans.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tidal forces on the atmosphere:&lt;/strong&gt; Tidal forces also have an effect on the atmosphere. The atmosphere is pulled towards the moon and the sun, creating a bulge in the atmosphere on the side of the Earth that is closest to the moon and the sun. The bulge in the atmosphere creates a slight pressure difference between the two sides of the Earth, which drives winds.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tidal forces on other planets and moons:&lt;/strong&gt; Tidal forces have an effect on other planets and moons in the solar system. For example, the moon&amp;rsquo;s tidal forces on the Earth cause the Earth to rotate more slowly over time. The Earth&amp;rsquo;s tidal forces on the moon have caused the moon to become tidally locked to the Earth, which means that the same side of the moon always faces the Earth.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tidal forces are a complex and fascinating topic. They play an important role in the Earth&amp;rsquo;s oceans, atmosphere, and solid Earth. Tidal forces also have an effect on other planets and moons in the solar system.&lt;/p&gt;
