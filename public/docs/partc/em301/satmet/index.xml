        &lt;h2&gt;Development of Satellite Meteorology&lt;span class=&#34;hx-absolute -hx-mt-20&#34; id=&#34;development-of-satellite-meteorology&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#development-of-satellite-meteorology&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The historical development of satellite meteorology can be traced back to the early days of the space race between the United States and the Soviet Union. In 1957, the Soviet Union launched Sputnik 1, the first artificial satellite to orbit Earth. Sputnik 1 provided the first space views of our planet&amp;rsquo;s surface and atmosphere, and its success spurred the development of meteorological satellites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first weather satellite, Vanguard 2, was launched by the United States in 1959. Vanguard 2 was designed to measure cloud cover distribution over the daylight portion of its orbit and to provide information on the density of the atmosphere. However, Vanguard 2 failed to achieve orbit, and &lt;strong&gt;it was not until 1960 that the first successful weather satellite, TIROS-1, was launched&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TIROS-1 was a polar-orbiting satellite that carried two television cameras. It provided the first global images of the Earth&amp;rsquo;s cloud cover, and it revolutionized the way that meteorologists monitored weather systems. TIROS-1 was followed by a series of increasingly sophisticated polar-orbiting weather satellites, including the Nimbus and NOAA series.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In 1966, the United States launched ATS-1, the first geostationary weather satellite.&lt;/strong&gt; Geostationary satellites orbit the Earth at an altitude of approximately 22,236 miles, and they remain in a fixed position over a particular point on the Earth&amp;rsquo;s surface. This makes them ideal for monitoring weather systems and providing real-time images of the Earth&amp;rsquo;s cloud cover.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, there are dozens of weather satellites in orbit around Earth, operated by a variety of nations and international organizations. These satellites provide meteorologists with a wealth of data about the Earth&amp;rsquo;s atmosphere, including cloud cover, temperature, moisture, and wind speed. This data is used to improve weather forecasts and to track severe weather events, such as hurricanes, tornadoes, and thunderstorms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Key milestones in the historical development of satellite meteorology:&lt;span class=&#34;hx-absolute -hx-mt-20&#34; id=&#34;key-milestones-in-the-historical-development-of-satellite-meteorology&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

1959: Launch of Vanguard 2, the first weather satellite.
1960: Launch of TIROS-1, the first successful weather satellite.
1966: Launch of ATS-1, the first geostationary weather satellite.
1970s: Development of the Nimbus and NOAA series of polar-orbiting weather satellites.
1980s: Development of the GOES and Meteosat series of geostationary weather satellites.
1990s: Development of new weather satellite sensors, such as microwave radiometers and infrared sounders.
2000s: Launch of a new generation of weather satellites, such as the NPP and JPSS series in the United States and the FY-3 series in China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Benefits of satellite meteorology:&lt;span class=&#34;hx-absolute -hx-mt-20&#34; id=&#34;benefits-of-satellite-meteorology&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#benefits-of-satellite-meteorology&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Satellite meteorology provides global coverage of the Earth&amp;rsquo;s atmosphere, which is essential for monitoring weather systems and tracking severe weather events.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Satellite meteorology provides real-time images of the Earth&amp;rsquo;s cloud cover, which is essential for improving weather forecasts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Satellite meteorology provides data about the Earth&amp;rsquo;s atmosphere that cannot be obtained from other sources, such as ground-based weather stations and aircraft.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Satellite meteorology has revolutionized the way that meteorologists monitor and forecast the weather. It has also played a vital role in our understanding of climate change.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <description>
        
        
        &lt;h2&gt;What is ISMP?&lt;span class=&#34;hx-absolute -hx-mt-20&#34; id=&#34;what-is-ismp&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#what-is-ismp&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Indian Satellite Meteorology Programme (ISMP) is a joint initiative of the Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) and the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO). The ISMP was established in the early 1970s, and it has played a vital role in the development of India&amp;rsquo;s meteorological capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What are the key objectives of ISMP?&lt;span class=&#34;hx-absolute -hx-mt-20&#34; id=&#34;what-are-the-key-objectives-of-ismp&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#what-are-the-key-objectives-of-ismp&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ISMP&amp;rsquo;s primary objective is to provide IMD with the satellite data needed to improve weather forecasting and to monitor climate change. The ISMP operates a fleet of geostationary and polar-orbiting weather satellites, which provide IMD with a wide range of data about the Earth&amp;rsquo;s atmosphere, including cloud cover, temperature, moisture, and wind speed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ISMP has made significant contributions to the improvement of weather forecasting in India. For example, IMD is now able to provide more accurate and timely warnings of severe weather events, such as cyclones, floods, and droughts. The ISMP has also played a vital role in the development of India&amp;rsquo;s climate change monitoring and research capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The following are some of the key milestones in the development of the ISMP:&lt;span class=&#34;hx-absolute -hx-mt-20&#34; id=&#34;the-following-are-some-of-the-key-milestones-in-the-development-of-the-ismp&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#the-following-are-some-of-the-key-milestones-in-the-development-of-the-ismp&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;1975: Launch of Aryabhata, India&amp;rsquo;s first satellite.

      <title>Quantitative estimation of sea surface temperature (SST)</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/docs/partc/em301/satmet/qestsst/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/docs/partc/em301/satmet/qestsst/</guid>
      <description>
        
        
        &lt;h2&gt;Quantitative estimation of sea surface temperature (SST) can be done using a variety of methods, including:&lt;span class=&#34;hx-absolute -hx-mt-20&#34; id=&#34;quantitative-estimation-of-sea-surface-temperature-sst-can-be-done-using-a-variety-of-methods-including&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#quantitative-estimation-of-sea-surface-temperature-sst-can-be-done-using-a-variety-of-methods-including&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Satellite remote sensing:&lt;/strong&gt; Satellites equipped with infrared and microwave sensors can be used to measure SST from space. These sensors measure the amount of infrared and microwave radiation emitted by the sea surface, which is related to its temperature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In situ measurements:&lt;/strong&gt; In situ measurements of SST can be made using a variety of sensors, such as buoys, ships, and aircraft. These sensors measure the temperature of the water directly.In situ measurements of SST are more accurate than satellite measurements, but they are limited in spatial and temporal coverage. In situ measurements are also more expensive to collect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Data assimilation:&lt;/strong&gt; Data assimilation techniques can be used to combine satellite and in situ measurements to produce a more accurate estimate of SST.Data assimilation techniques take into account the uncertainties in the satellite and in situ measurements to produce the best possible estimate of SST.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Satellite remote sensing is the most widely used method for quantitative estimation of SST. It provides global coverage with high spatial and temporal resolution. However, satellite SST measurements can be affected by factors such as clouds and aerosols.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What are the uses of SST&lt;span class=&#34;hx-absolute -hx-mt-20&#34; id=&#34;what-are-the-uses-of-sst&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#what-are-the-uses-of-sst&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once SST has been estimated, it can be used for a variety of purposes, such as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Monitoring climate change:&lt;/strong&gt; SST is an important indicator of climate change. By monitoring SST over time, scientists can track how the Earth&amp;rsquo;s climate is changing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Forecasting weather:&lt;/strong&gt; SST is used in weather forecasting models to predict the formation and movement of weather systems, such as hurricanes and typhoons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Monitoring marine ecosystems:&lt;/strong&gt; SST is an important factor in the distribution and abundance of marine life. By monitoring SST, scientists can track changes in marine ecosystems and identify potential threats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quantitative estimation of SST is an important tool for scientists and policymakers. It provides valuable information about the Earth&amp;rsquo;s climate and marine ecosystems.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;h2&gt;What are Remote sensing Techniques used for meteorology?&lt;span class=&#34;hx-absolute -hx-mt-20&#34; id=&#34;what-are-remote-sensing-techniques-used-for-meteorology&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#what-are-remote-sensing-techniques-used-for-meteorology&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Remote sensing techniques are used in meteorology to measure and monitor atmospheric conditions from a distance. This is done by detecting and measuring electromagnetic radiation emitted or reflected by the atmosphere and its constituents, such as clouds, aerosols, and precipitation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Different types of remote sensing techniques are used in meteorology, including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Satellite imagery: Satellites provide global coverage of the atmosphere, allowing meteorologists to track weather systems and monitor climate trends. Satellite imagery can be used to measure cloud cover, cloud type, precipitation, sea surface temperature, and other atmospheric variables.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Radar: Radar is used to measure wind speed and direction, precipitation intensity, and the location and intensity of thunderstorms. Radar can also be used to track tornadoes and other severe weather events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lidar: Lidar (light detection and ranging) uses laser light to measure the distance to objects in the atmosphere. Lidar can be used to measure cloud height, aerosol concentration, and wind speed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4.Microwave radiometry: Microwave radiometry measures the microwave radiation emitted by the atmosphere and its constituents. Microwave radiometry can be used to measure temperature, humidity, and precipitation.
Remote sensing techniques are used in meteorology for a variety of purposes, including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How are Remote sensing techniques used?&lt;span class=&#34;hx-absolute -hx-mt-20&#34; id=&#34;how-are-remote-sensing-techniques-used&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#how-are-remote-sensing-techniques-used&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Weather forecasting: Remote sensing data is used to produce weather forecasts, including predictions of cloud cover, precipitation, and temperature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Severe weather monitoring: Remote sensing data is used to monitor severe weather events, such as thunderstorms, tornadoes, and hurricanes. This information can be used to issue early warnings and help people protect themselves from harm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Climate monitoring: Remote sensing data is used to monitor climate trends and changes in the Earth&amp;rsquo;s atmosphere. This information is used to understand the causes of climate change and to develop strategies to mitigate its effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Here are some specific examples of how remote sensing techniques are used in meteorology:&lt;span class=&#34;hx-absolute -hx-mt-20&#34; id=&#34;here-are-some-specific-examples-of-how-remote-sensing-techniques-are-used-in-meteorology&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#here-are-some-specific-examples-of-how-remote-sensing-techniques-are-used-in-meteorology&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Satellite imagery is used to track the movement of hurricanes and other tropical storms. This information can be used to issue timely warnings to coastal communities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Radar is used to track thunderstorms and tornadoes. This information can be used to issue tornado warnings and to help people evacuate areas that are at risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lidar is used to measure the height of clouds and to detect the presence of volcanic ash in the atmosphere. This information can be used to help pilots avoid dangerous conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microwave radiometry is used to measure the temperature and humidity of the atmosphere. This information can be used to produce weather forecasts and to monitor climate trends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remote sensing techniques are essential tools for meteorologists. They provide data that would otherwise be impossible to obtain, and they play a vital role in weather forecasting, severe weather monitoring, and climate research.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Synoptic cloud patterns and their interpretation.</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/docs/partc/em301/satmet/synclouds/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/docs/partc/em301/satmet/synclouds/</guid>
      <description>
        
        
        &lt;h2&gt;What are Synoptic cloud patterns?&lt;span class=&#34;hx-absolute -hx-mt-20&#34; id=&#34;what-are-synoptic-cloud-patterns&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#what-are-synoptic-cloud-patterns&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Synoptic cloud patterns are large-scale cloud formations that are associated with specific weather systems. Meteorologists use synoptic cloud patterns to identify and track these weather systems, and to forecast future weather conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Some of the most common synoptic cloud patterns include:&lt;span class=&#34;hx-absolute -hx-mt-20&#34; id=&#34;some-of-the-most-common-synoptic-cloud-patterns-include&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#some-of-the-most-common-synoptic-cloud-patterns-include&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cirrus clouds:&lt;/strong&gt; Cirrus clouds are thin, wispy clouds that are high in the atmosphere. They are often associated with fair weather, but they can also be a sign of approaching bad weather.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Altostratus clouds:&lt;/strong&gt; Altostratus clouds are gray or blue-gray clouds that cover the entire sky. They are often associated with drizzle or light rain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nimbostratus clouds:&lt;/strong&gt; Nimbostratus clouds are dark gray clouds that produce continuous rain or snow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cumulus clouds:&lt;/strong&gt;  Cumulus clouds are puffy, white clouds that develop in fair weather. They can grow into thunderstorms if they are tall and have dark bases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cumulonimbus clouds:&lt;/strong&gt; Cumulonimbus clouds are tall, dark clouds that produce thunderstorms, tornadoes, and hail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meteorologists use synoptic cloud patterns to interpret the current weather conditions and to forecast future weather conditions. For example, a band of altostratus clouds moving from west to east is often a sign of an approaching cold front. A line of cumulonimbus clouds is a sign of an active thunderstorm complex.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Here are some specific examples of how synoptic cloud patterns are used to interpret weather conditions:&lt;span class=&#34;hx-absolute -hx-mt-20&#34; id=&#34;here-are-some-specific-examples-of-how-synoptic-cloud-patterns-are-used-to-interpret-weather-conditions&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#here-are-some-specific-examples-of-how-synoptic-cloud-patterns-are-used-to-interpret-weather-conditions&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A band of cirrus clouds moving from west to east is often a sign of an approaching cold front. Cold fronts are associated with unstable air, which can lead to thunderstorms and other severe weather.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A line of cumulonimbus clouds is a sign of an active thunderstorm complex. Thunderstorm complexes can produce heavy rain, strong winds, and hail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A large area of altostratus clouds covering the sky is often a sign of a warm front. Warm fronts are associated with stable air, which typically leads to cloudy conditions and light rain or drizzle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A large area of nimbostratus clouds covering the sky is often a sign of an occluded front. Occluded fronts are formed when a cold front overtakes a warm front. They are associated with cloudy conditions and moderate to heavy precipitation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Here are some specific examples of how synoptic cloud patterns are used to forecast weather conditions:&lt;span class=&#34;hx-absolute -hx-mt-20&#34; id=&#34;here-are-some-specific-examples-of-how-synoptic-cloud-patterns-are-used-to-forecast-weather-conditions&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#here-are-some-specific-examples-of-how-synoptic-cloud-patterns-are-used-to-forecast-weather-conditions&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a band of altostratus clouds is moving from west to east, meteorologists may forecast that a cold front will pass through the area in the next 12-24 hours. This information can be used to issue early warnings for severe weather, such as thunderstorms and tornadoes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a line of cumulonimbus clouds is approaching an area, meteorologists may forecast that thunderstorms will develop. This information can be used to issue early warnings for thunderstorms and to advise people to take shelter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a large area of altostratus or nimbostratus clouds is covering an area, meteorologists may forecast that rain or snow will fall. This information can be used to issue weather advisories and to advise people to plan accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By understanding synoptic cloud patterns, meteorologists can better interpret the current weather conditions and forecast future weather conditions. This information is essential for public safety and for economic planning.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Satellite data is essential for tropical storm analysis. It provides meteorologists with a global view of tropical storms, allowing them to track their movement, intensity, and structure. Satellite data is also used to assess the potential for tropical storms to produce hazardous weather conditions, such as heavy rain, strong winds, and storm surge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Here are some specific examples of how satellite data is used for tropical storm analysis:&lt;span class=&#34;hx-absolute -hx-mt-20&#34; id=&#34;here-are-some-specific-examples-of-how-satellite-data-is-used-for-tropical-storm-analysis&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#here-are-some-specific-examples-of-how-satellite-data-is-used-for-tropical-storm-analysis&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To track the movement of tropical storms.&lt;/strong&gt; Satellite imagery can be used to track the movement of tropical storms over time. This information is used to produce forecasts of the storm&amp;rsquo;s track and to issue early warnings to coastal communities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To measure the intensity of tropical storms.&lt;/strong&gt; Satellite imagery can be used to measure the intensity of tropical storms by estimating the wind speed and cloud top temperature. This information is used to produce forecasts of the storm&amp;rsquo;s intensity and to issue early warnings for hurricane-force winds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To assess the structure of tropical storms.&lt;/strong&gt; Satellite imagery can be used to assess the structure of tropical storms by identifying features such as the eye, eyewall, and spiral rainbands. This information can be used to forecast the potential for the storm to produce hazardous weather conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To identify areas at risk for heavy rain.&lt;/strong&gt; Satellite imagery can be used to identify areas at risk for heavy rain by tracking the movement of rainbands and estimating the rainfall rate. This information can be used to issue flash flood warnings and advisories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To monitor storm surge.&lt;/strong&gt; Satellite imagery can be used to monitor storm surge by measuring the sea surface height and the wind speed. This information can be used to issue storm surge warnings and advisories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Satellite data is also used to develop and improve tropical storm models. These models are used to produce forecasts of the storm&amp;rsquo;s track, intensity, and structure. Satellite data is also used to validate these models and to ensure that they are producing accurate forecasts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, satellite data is essential for tropical storm analysis. It provides meteorologists with the information they need to track, monitor, and forecast tropical storms. This information is used to protect lives and property by issuing early warnings for hazardous weather conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

      <link>http://localhost:1313/docs/partc/em301/satmet/vertprof/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/docs/partc/em301/satmet/vertprof/</guid>
      <description>
        
        
        &lt;h2&gt;How Vertical profiles of temperature and Humidity can be measured?&lt;span class=&#34;hx-absolute -hx-mt-20&#34; id=&#34;how-vertical-profiles-of-temperature-and-humidity-can-be-measured&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#how-vertical-profiles-of-temperature-and-humidity-can-be-measured&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vertical profiles of temperature and humidity from satellite pictures can be retrieved using a variety of methods. One common method is to use infrared sounders. Infrared sounders measure the amount of infrared radiation emitted by the atmosphere at different wavelengths. This information can be used to infer the temperature and humidity of the atmosphere at different altitudes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another method for retrieving vertical profiles of temperature and humidity from satellite pictures is to use microwave radiometers. Microwave radiometers measure the amount of microwave radiation emitted by the atmosphere at different wavelengths. This information can also be used to infer the temperature and humidity of the atmosphere at different altitudes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A third method for retrieving vertical profiles of temperature and humidity from satellite pictures is to use a combination of infrared and microwave measurements. This method is often used to produce more accurate and detailed vertical profiles of temperature and humidity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How are vertical profiles of temperatures used?&lt;span class=&#34;hx-absolute -hx-mt-20&#34; id=&#34;how-are-vertical-profiles-of-temperatures-used&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#how-are-vertical-profiles-of-temperatures-used&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once vertical profiles of temperature and humidity have been retrieved from satellite pictures, they can be used for a variety of purposes, such as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Weather forecasting:&lt;/strong&gt; Vertical profiles of temperature and humidity are used in weather forecasting models to predict the formation and movement of weather systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Climate monitoring:&lt;/strong&gt; Vertical profiles of temperature and humidity are used to monitor climate change. By monitoring vertical profiles of temperature and humidity over time, scientists can track how the Earth&amp;rsquo;s climate is changing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Atmospheric research:&lt;/strong&gt; Vertical profiles of temperature and humidity are used for a variety of atmospheric research purposes, such as studying the dynamics of the atmosphere and the formation of clouds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Here are some specific examples of how vertical profiles of temperature and humidity from satellite pictures are used:&lt;span class=&#34;hx-absolute -hx-mt-20&#34; id=&#34;here-are-some-specific-examples-of-how-vertical-profiles-of-temperature-and-humidity-from-satellite-pictures-are-used&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#here-are-some-specific-examples-of-how-vertical-profiles-of-temperature-and-humidity-from-satellite-pictures-are-used&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To forecast the intensity of hurricanes. Vertical profiles of temperature and humidity can be used to forecast the intensity of hurricanes by providing information about the amount of energy available to fuel the storm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To monitor the development of thunderstorms. Vertical profiles of temperature and humidity can be used to monitor the development of thunderstorms by identifying areas where the atmosphere is unstable and thunderstorms are likely to form.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To study the impact of climate change on the atmosphere. Vertical profiles of temperature and humidity can be used to study the impact of climate change on the atmosphere by tracking changes in the temperature and humidity of the atmosphere over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vertical profiles of temperature and humidity from satellite pictures are an important tool for meteorologists and climate scientists. They provide valuable information about the atmosphere and its dynamics.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Visual and Infra red Channels</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/docs/partc/em301/satmet/vandirchannels/</link>

      <description>
        
        
        &lt;h2&gt;What are  Visual and Infra Red Channels in Satellite Meteorology&lt;span class=&#34;hx-absolute -hx-mt-20&#34; id=&#34;what-are--visual-and-infra-red-channels-in-satellite-meteorology&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#what-are--visual-and-infra-red-channels-in-satellite-meteorology&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Satellite Meteorology ,visual and infrared channels are used to detect and measure different atmospheric conditions and phenomena.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Visible channels:&lt;/strong&gt; Visible channels detect electromagnetic radiation in the visible spectrum, which is the range of wavelengths that can be seen by the human eye. Visible channels are used to image clouds, fog, and other features on the Earth&amp;rsquo;s surface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Infrared channels:&lt;/strong&gt; Infrared channels detect electromagnetic radiation in the infrared spectrum, which is a range of wavelengths that are invisible to the human eye but can be felt as heat. Infrared channels are used to image the temperature of clouds, the Earth&amp;rsquo;s surface, and other objects in the atmosphere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Meteorologists use visual and infrared channels in combination to get a more complete picture of atmospheric conditions. For example, visible channels can be used to identify the type of clouds present in a weather system, while infrared channels can be used to measure the cloud top temperature. This information can then be used to infer the altitude of the clouds and to assess the potential for precipitation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Here are some specific examples of how meteorological visual and infrared channels are used:&lt;span class=&#34;hx-absolute -hx-mt-20&#34; id=&#34;here-are-some-specific-examples-of-how-meteorological-visual-and-infrared-channels-are-used&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#here-are-some-specific-examples-of-how-meteorological-visual-and-infrared-channels-are-used&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To identify the type of clouds present in a weather system.&lt;/strong&gt; For example, cirrus clouds are typically cold and have high tops, while cumulonimbus clouds are typically warm and have low tops. This information can be used to assess the potential for precipitation and other hazardous weather conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To measure the cloud top temperature.&lt;/strong&gt; This information can be used to infer the altitude of the clouds and to assess the potential for precipitation. For example, colder cloud tops are typically associated with higher altitude clouds, which are more likely to produce precipitation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To track the movement of weather systems.&lt;/strong&gt;  For example, visible channels can be used to track the movement of clouds and infrared channels can be used to track the movement of sea surface temperatures. This information can be used to produce weather forecasts and to issue early warnings for severe weather events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To monitor climate trends.&lt;/strong&gt;  For example, satellite imagery can be used to monitor changes in cloud cover, sea surface temperature, and other climate variables over time. This information can be used to understand the causes of climate change and to develop strategies to mitigate its effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meteorological visual and infrared channels are essential tools for meteorologists. They provide data that would otherwise be impossible to obtain, and they play a vital role in weather forecasting, severe weather monitoring, and climate research.&lt;/p&gt;
