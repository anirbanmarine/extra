        &lt;h2&gt;Development of Satellite Meteorology&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;development-of-satellite-meteorology&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#development-of-satellite-meteorology&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The historical development of satellite meteorology can be traced back to the early days of the space race between the United States and the Soviet Union. In 1957, the Soviet Union launched Sputnik 1, the first artificial satellite to orbit Earth. Sputnik 1 provided the first space views of our planet&amp;rsquo;s surface and atmosphere, and its success spurred the development of meteorological satellites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first weather satellite, Vanguard 2, was launched by the United States in 1959. Vanguard 2 was designed to measure cloud cover distribution over the daylight portion of its orbit and to provide information on the density of the atmosphere. However, Vanguard 2 failed to achieve orbit, and &lt;strong&gt;it was not until 1960 that the first successful weather satellite, TIROS-1, was launched&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TIROS-1 was a polar-orbiting satellite that carried two television cameras. It provided the first global images of the Earth&amp;rsquo;s cloud cover, and it revolutionized the way that meteorologists monitored weather systems. TIROS-1 was followed by a series of increasingly sophisticated polar-orbiting weather satellites, including the Nimbus and NOAA series.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In 1966, the United States launched ATS-1, the first geostationary weather satellite.&lt;/strong&gt; Geostationary satellites orbit the Earth at an altitude of approximately 22,236 miles, and they remain in a fixed position over a particular point on the Earth&amp;rsquo;s surface. This makes them ideal for monitoring weather systems and providing real-time images of the Earth&amp;rsquo;s cloud cover.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, there are dozens of weather satellites in orbit around Earth, operated by a variety of nations and international organizations. These satellites provide meteorologists with a wealth of data about the Earth&amp;rsquo;s atmosphere, including cloud cover, temperature, moisture, and wind speed. This data is used to improve weather forecasts and to track severe weather events, such as hurricanes, tornadoes, and thunderstorms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Key milestones in the historical development of satellite meteorology:&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;key-milestones-in-the-historical-development-of-satellite-meteorology&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

1959: Launch of Vanguard 2, the first weather satellite.
1960: Launch of TIROS-1, the first successful weather satellite.
1966: Launch of ATS-1, the first geostationary weather satellite.
1970s: Development of the Nimbus and NOAA series of polar-orbiting weather satellites.
1980s: Development of the GOES and Meteosat series of geostationary weather satellites.
1990s: Development of new weather satellite sensors, such as microwave radiometers and infrared sounders.
2000s: Launch of a new generation of weather satellites, such as the NPP and JPSS series in the United States and the FY-3 series in China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Benefits of satellite meteorology:&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;benefits-of-satellite-meteorology&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#benefits-of-satellite-meteorology&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Satellite meteorology provides global coverage of the Earth&amp;rsquo;s atmosphere, which is essential for monitoring weather systems and tracking severe weather events.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Satellite meteorology provides real-time images of the Earth&amp;rsquo;s cloud cover, which is essential for improving weather forecasts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Satellite meteorology provides data about the Earth&amp;rsquo;s atmosphere that cannot be obtained from other sources, such as ground-based weather stations and aircraft.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Satellite meteorology has revolutionized the way that meteorologists monitor and forecast the weather. It has also played a vital role in our understanding of climate change.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        &lt;h2&gt;What is ISMP?&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;what-is-ismp&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#what-is-ismp&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Indian Satellite Meteorology Programme (ISMP) is a joint initiative of the Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) and the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO). The ISMP was established in the early 1970s, and it has played a vital role in the development of India&amp;rsquo;s meteorological capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What are the key objectives of ISMP?&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;what-are-the-key-objectives-of-ismp&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#what-are-the-key-objectives-of-ismp&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ISMP&amp;rsquo;s primary objective is to provide IMD with the satellite data needed to improve weather forecasting and to monitor climate change. The ISMP operates a fleet of geostationary and polar-orbiting weather satellites, which provide IMD with a wide range of data about the Earth&amp;rsquo;s atmosphere, including cloud cover, temperature, moisture, and wind speed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ISMP has made significant contributions to the improvement of weather forecasting in India. For example, IMD is now able to provide more accurate and timely warnings of severe weather events, such as cyclones, floods, and droughts. The ISMP has also played a vital role in the development of India&amp;rsquo;s climate change monitoring and research capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The following are some of the key milestones in the development of the ISMP:&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;the-following-are-some-of-the-key-milestones-in-the-development-of-the-ismp&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#the-following-are-some-of-the-key-milestones-in-the-development-of-the-ismp&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;1975: Launch of Aryabhata, India&amp;rsquo;s first satellite.
1979: Launch of Bhaskara-1, India&amp;rsquo;s first satellite dedicated to earth observation.
1982: Launch of INSAT-1A, India&amp;rsquo;s first geostationary satellite.
1997: Launch of Kalpana-1 (formerly METSAT), India&amp;rsquo;s first satellite dedicated to meteorological observations.
2013: Launch of INSAT-3D, India&amp;rsquo;s first geostationary satellite to carry a sounder.
2016: Launch of INSAT-3DR, India&amp;rsquo;s second geostationary satellite to carry a sounder.
The ISMP is a major success story, and it has played a vital role in the development of India&amp;rsquo;s meteorological and climate change monitoring capabilities. The ISMP is also a valuable example of the successful cooperation between IMD and ISRO.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;In addition to the above, the ISMP is also involved in a number of other important activities, such as:&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;in-addition-to-the-above-the-ismp-is-also-involved-in-a-number-of-other-important-activities-such-as&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#in-addition-to-the-above-the-ismp-is-also-involved-in-a-number-of-other-important-activities-such-as&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Developing new satellite-based meteorological products and services.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Providing training to IMD staff on the use of satellite data for weather forecasting and climate monitoring.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Collaborating with other national and international organizations on satellite meteorology research and development.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ISMP is a dynamic and growing program, and it is committed to providing India with the best possible satellite-based meteorological data and services.&lt;/p&gt;
