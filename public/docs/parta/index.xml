    &lt;a href=&#34;#q1&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;lsquo;X&amp;rsquo; is the owner and manager of a company with ten employees. &amp;lsquo;X&amp;rsquo; hires you to take over the functions of the HRM in the company
&amp;lsquo;X&amp;rsquo; believes that the company may be able to save costs by allowing employees to work from home one or two days in a week. However, He has some concerns about productivity if he allows employees to work from home. Despite these concerns, &amp;lsquo;X&amp;rsquo; has even considered closing down the physical office and making his company a virtual organization, but he wonders how such a major change will affect the ability of the employees to communicate and what impact it will have on their motivation.
&amp;ldquo;X also shares with you his thoughts about the costs of health care on the organization. He has considered cutting benefits entirely and having his employees work for him on a contract basis, instead of being full-time employees. He isn&amp;rsquo;t sure if this would be a good choice.
During your first two weeks, you find out that the company is expected to experience overall revenue growth by 10 percent over the next three years, with some quarters secing growth as high as 30 percent. However, five of the ten workers are expected to retire within three years. These workers have been with the organization since the beginning and provide a unique historical perspective of the company. The other five workers are of diverse ages.
&amp;lsquo;X&amp;rsquo; schedules a meeting with you to discuss some of his thoughts. To prepare for the meeting, you perform research so you can provide your new employer with recommendations on the challenges presented.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;a href=&#34;#5-what-impact-the-proposed-changes-could-have-on-the-prospects-of-the-company&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;** 1. Changes Affecting HRM:** 
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Shift to Remote or Virtual Work: The potential move to remote work, either partially or entirely, changes how performance is managed, collaboration occurs, and company culture is maintained.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Workforce Transition and Retirement: With five out of ten employees set to retire in three years, the company faces a significant loss of institutional knowledge and experience.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Growth and Scaling: Projected revenue growth of up to 30% in some quarters may require additional hiring and enhanced workforce capabilities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Potential Shift to Contract-Based Workforce: Moving from full-time employees to contract workers changes the approach to benefits, job security, and company loyalty.
2. Considerations for Change:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Productivity and Communication: Remote work can boost productivity for some but may hinder collaboration and real-time communication.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Employee Motivation and Morale: Reducing benefits or transitioning to contract work may lower job satisfaction and increase turnover.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Knowledge Retention: The impending retirement of long-term employees requires a strategy to capture their expertise.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scalability: Rapid growth demands a scalable HR strategy for recruitment, onboarding, and development.
3. Initial Planning Steps:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Conduct Employee Surveys: Assess employees’ willingness and readiness for remote work and their views on benefit changes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Knowledge Transfer Plan: Develop mentorship and documentation programs to preserve institutional knowledge.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Workforce Planning: Identify future talent needs aligned with projected growth.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cost-Benefit Analysis: Compare the financial impact of maintaining full-time employees versus transitioning to a contract-based workforce.
4. Implementation Roles:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;HRM’s Role: Drive change management, support employee engagement, and develop strategic HR plans.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;X’s Role: Set the vision, make final decisions, and maintain open communication with employees.
5. Impact on Company Prospects:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Positive Impacts: Remote work and contract flexibility can reduce costs and increase scalability.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Potential Risks: Loss of institutional knowledge, lower morale, and recruitment challenges could harm productivity and growth.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Balanced Approach: A hybrid model, phased retirement plans, and strategic hiring can mitigate risks while supporting growth.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

The Port has two other Container Terminals, operated by other private parties. (All the three terminals are leased out to the operators on revenue share basis). The Port is connected to the hinterland by rail and road. Capacity of rail and road is limited, but capacity expansion projects are already underway (Doubling railway lines and road 4-laning). Your terminal has secured additional yardage space near the Port. The terminal has three high-capacity Rail-mounted Port-Panamax Gantry Cranes on the dockside and sufficient RTGs and forklifts for Yard handling of Containers. The Operators are planning to install rail lines on the terminal to provide direct access to rail wagons from the main line. While your Terminal has one large Container Line as a captive client (5-year contract), there are many other mainline and feeder services who are potential clients, some of whom are being served by competing terminals.&lt;/p&gt;

IL&amp;amp;FS (Infrastructure Leasing &amp;amp; Financial Services) was a major Indian infrastructure development and finance company that faced a significant financial crisis in 2018. The company&amp;rsquo;s downfall was attributed to several factors, including financial mismanagement. Here are some key events and decisions that contributed to IL&amp;amp;FS&amp;rsquo;s financial woes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over-expansion and Diversification
IL&amp;amp;FS expanded rapidly into various sectors, including roads, energy, and real estate. This diversification led to a complex web of subsidiaries and joint ventures, making it challenging to manage risk and maintain financial discipline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aggressive Lending and Investment
IL&amp;amp;FS engaged in aggressive lending and investment activities, often without adequate risk assessment and due diligence. This led to a significant buildup of non-performing assets (NPAs) and stressed assets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;High Leverage and Debt
IL&amp;amp;FS relied heavily on debt to finance its expansion and investments. The company&amp;rsquo;s debt-to-equity ratio was extremely high, making it vulnerable to interest rate changes and liquidity crises.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Poor Governance and Risk Management
IL&amp;amp;FS&amp;rsquo;s governance structure and risk management practices were inadequate, allowing for poor decision-making and a lack of oversight. The company&amp;rsquo;s board and management failed to address the growing risks and financial stress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Accounting Irregularities and Fraud
Investigations revealed accounting irregularities and fraudulent activities within IL&amp;amp;FS, including the use of complex financial instruments to conceal the true state of the company&amp;rsquo;s finances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Liquidity Crisis and Default
In 2018, IL&amp;amp;FS faced a severe liquidity crisis, which led to a series of debt defaults. The company&amp;rsquo;s financial woes triggered a contagion effect, impacting the entire Indian financial system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Government Intervention and Restructuring
The Indian government intervened to prevent a complete collapse of IL&amp;amp;FS. The company underwent a significant restructuring, including the appointment of a new board and management, and the sale of various assets to reduce debt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The IL&amp;amp;FS crisis highlighted the importance of robust governance, risk management, and regulatory oversight in the financial sector. It also underscored the need for companies to maintain prudent financial practices and avoid excessive leverage and risk-taking&lt;/p&gt;

Q.6 What principles of compensation would you apply for a large organization with multiple specializations, task diversity and many layers of staff and management? What are the likely sources of discontent with respect to compensation in such an organization? [25 Marks)
Designing an effective compensation strategy for a large organization with multiple specializations, task diversity, and numerous layers of staff and management requires careful consideration of various principles. Here are key principles to consider:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;** Market Competitiveness** : Ensure that compensation packages are competitive within the relevant labor market. Conduct regular market surveys to benchmark salaries and benefits against industry standards, taking into account regional differences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;** Internal Equity** : Establish a fair and transparent pay structure that values roles based on their responsibilities, required skills, and contributions to the organization. This involves creating a job evaluation process to assess the relative value of different positions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;** Performance-Based Compensation** : Implement performance-based pay structures, such as bonuses or merit increases, that incentivize high performance and align employee efforts with organizational goals. This can include individual, team, and organizational performance metrics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;** Diversity and Inclusion** : Develop compensation practices that promote equity and inclusion. Ensure that pay practices are free from biases related to gender, ethnicity, age, or other factors, thus fostering a diverse workplace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;** Flexibility and Customization** : Consider flexible compensation options to meet the diverse needs of employees. This may include choices in benefits, work-life balance options, and opportunities for professional development, recognizing that different roles and employees may have varying preferences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;** Total Compensation Approach** : Look beyond base salary to encompass total compensation, including bonuses, benefits (health insurance, retirement plans, etc.), stock options, and non-monetary perks (work environment, culture, etc.). Highlighting the value of the complete package can enhance employee satisfaction and retention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;** Clear Communication** : Provide clear and transparent communication regarding compensation policies, structures, and processes. This fosters trust and understanding among employees and helps them appreciate the benefits of their total compensation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;** Regulatory Compliance** : Ensure compliance with labor laws and regulations, including minimum wage, overtime, equal pay, and taxes. Regular audits are essential to maintain compliance and avoid costly penalties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;** Regular Review and Adjustments** : Establish a process for regularly reviewing and adjusting compensation strategies to adapt to changing market conditions, economic factors, and organizational needs. This ensures that compensation remains relevant and competitive over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;** Employee Involvement and Feedback** : Engage employees in discussions about compensation and solicit feedback on the effectiveness of compensation strategies. This can include surveys or focus groups, helping to align compensation with employee expectations and values.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;** Career Progression and Development** : Include structured career progression and development opportunities as part of the compensation philosophy. This helps motivate employees by providing clear pathways for advancement and increases retention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By applying these principles, a large organization can create a compensation strategy that supports its diverse workforce, enhances employee engagement, and drives overall organizational success.

Q.1.Read the case study and answer the questions:
China&amp;rsquo;s seaborne iron ore imports last year accounted for over 70% of global imports, 1,047mt out of 1,476mt. But the 2018 import total was 1% down on 2017, the first year-on-year decline since 2010, when the country&amp;rsquo;s imports fell 1.5% to 619mt from 628mt in 2009.
The latest Dry Bulk Trades outlook forecasts for the country indicates flat imports this year of 1,048mt, down 1.5% from its early January estimate of 1,064mt. The 16mt shortfall represents a combination of lower available iron ore supply and weaker iron ore import demand.
The situation in the said country is that steel prices have fallen, while raw material input costs have risen, leading to an untenable squeeze on steel mill margins.
In January/February this year, the country imported 174.4mt of iron ore, down 5.5% on the 184.6mt that it imported in the same period last year. There is the distortional impact of the lunar new-year holidays, when steel mills and traders shut down for up to two weeks, and the impact of rising iron ore prices as availability shrank in 1&amp;rdquo; quarter.
62% Fe, CFR China iron ore prices rose 24% from $74.6pmt on 25 January to $92.3pmt on 7 February. They then dipped to a low of $84.5pmt on 11 March before recovering to $92.2pmt yesterday. Prices averaged under $70 a tonne in 2018.
When prices rise, buyers in that country buy less, draw down their port and other stocks, switch to lower grade imports, and use inferior quality and cheaper domestic supplies. Some blast furnace output is replaced by electric are furnaces that use steel scrap as feedstock. The end result is lower iron ore demand, and higher imports from nearby country at the expense of long-haul imports: a tonne-mile loss. This is disastrous cocktail for capesize bulk carriers.
Through the fog of distorting factors, it is hard to assess what is temporary and what is structural. Import tariffs raise prices for households and reduce discretionary spending.
The countries slower economic growth, 6.6% last year and possibly 6.3% this year, are the lowest rates of GDP growth in the last 30 years. The country is transitioning to lesser levels of industrial and manufacturing intensity as it tackles pollution, outsources functions to Southeast Asia and reduces over-capacity as it rolls out and supports its Belt and Road Initiative. In industrial terms, it is a progressive switch from heavy industry to light industry as services grow. Capes and other bulk carriers were expected to benefit from a supply-led rather than a demand-led recovery this year. We anticipated low levels of tonnage supply and robust demand growth, but QI&amp;rsquo;s events require the forecasts to be adjusted down a bit. As usual, we have witnessed mass panic as a series of what should be temporary events have hijacked sentiment and confidence. This quickly depresses freight rates, earnings and values.

&lt;p&gt;EM 103 14-06-2019&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q.1 In September 2017, a product tanker &amp;lsquo;Z&amp;rsquo; (1,597GT; built 1972), manned by 11 crew members, was at anchor at the Piraeus anchorage area in Greece, awaiting the arrival of a vessel at the Piraeus Container Terminal, to which she was scheduled to deliver bunkers late in the evening of the same day. The vessel is reported to have about 2194 metric tons of Heavy Fuel Oil; 370 MT of Marine Gas oil, about 15 metric tons of bunkers (MGO), approximately 300 litres of lubricants and 200-300 litres of chemicals, in total carrying approximately 2 580 metric tons of oil cargo, bunkers and chemicals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ship was insured for oil pollution risks and wreck removal. However, the ship did not have any hull insurance. The insurance policy between the ship-owner and the insurer contained an overall limit of liability of €5 million. The insurer indicated that it had offered the ship-owner additional insurance to raise its cover but that the ship-owner had indicated that it would &amp;lsquo;self-insure&amp;rsquo; for any additional liabilities. However, it appears that the ship-owner did not obtain additional insurance over that provided by the insurer.
Greece is a party to the Civil Liability and Fund Convention and under Greek law. Under Greek law, any ship sailing to or from a Greek port or terminal must be insured for the obligations of wreck removal towards the Greek State, up to the limits of liability specified within the Convention on Limitation of Liability for Maritime Claims (LLMC 1976)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 45 year old vessel&amp;rsquo;s certificate had expired earlier on 26th July 2017, which was extended for 2 months up to 27th September 2017. The vessel sank at anchor before the extended certificate expired under unexplained circumstances in benign weather conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before the vessel sank at the anchorage area in the Piraeus anchorage area, the master allowed seven crew members to proceed to shore to have a meal and return on board between 2100-2130 hours, leaving four crew members on board, including the master&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As bunkering was postponed for the following morning, the master contacted the crew who were ashore and asked them to return to the vessel early in the morning of the next day. At around 2315 hours, he took with him one of the crew and went ashore to have a meal, leaving the vessel manned by the two remaining crew members.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At around 0155 hours on early in the morning, while waiting to take the launch boat to return on board, the master received a phone call from one of the crew members on board, telling him that the vessel had sustained a list Approximately five minutes later, the master received a further call advising him that the situation was getting …. following which the master contacted a local tug company requesting the dispatch of two tugs to the vessel for assistance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The launch boat with the master and the crew departed from shore at around 0215 hours and upon arrival at the casualty site at around 0230 hours, found that most of the ship&amp;rsquo;s hull was underwater, with only 3 metres of the bow being visible above the sea level. Shortly afterwards, the vessel disappeared underwater. The two crew members who were on board had in the meantime jumped in the water and were collected by the launch boat and one of the tugs which had proceeded to the site for assistance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sinking caused extensive pollution damage&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ship-owner was subsequently informed, who in turn gave instructions to a salvor to undertake salvage operations. The salvor sub-contracted clean-up contractors to provide assistance with the antipollution measures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The master and the chief engineer were initially arrested and then released pending trial for negligence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Discuss the following&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a) The Greek legal system and the major differences with the Indian legal system. and reasons for the same. Who is responsible to pay for the pollution damage?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;b) Was the insurance amount adequate as per the applicable Conventions and local Greek law? If the liability claims exceed the insured amount of 5 mittion Euros, how are the claims to be met?
c) Is the insurer liable to make payment if the vessel was deliberately scuttled, or if it was sabotaged?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;d) The legal implications of the extension given to the certificates of a 45 year old vessel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;e) Can the master and Chief engineer be criminally prosecuted for negligence? If so, what could be the grounds of prosecution and the possible defences? [50 Marks]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q.2 The general cargo vessel &amp;lsquo;M&amp;rsquo; loaded steel coils in Marseilles. The loading process was spread over several days and for some time during this period, there was a strike by the tally clerks, but loading of steel coils was not interrupted. On completion of loading, the Shipper informed the Master that 15,000 coils of steel, each weighing 2 tons had been loaded on board. The Master issued a clean &amp;lsquo;Bill of Lading&amp;rsquo; for 15,000 coils stating &amp;ldquo;Shipper&amp;rsquo;s load, stow and count; 15000 coils, said to weigh 2 tons each&amp;rdquo;. The &amp;lsquo;Bill of Lading&amp;rsquo; incorporated the Hague Visby Rules. The shipper endorsed the bill of lading to &amp;ldquo;P&amp;rdquo; the purchaser of the steel coils who paid the full price of 15,000 steel coils and to whom the property in the steel coils was transferred.
ΘG
At Mumbai the designated port of discharge, only 14,900 steel coils were found on board and were delivered to &amp;lsquo;P&amp;rsquo;.
&amp;lsquo;P&amp;rsquo; sued the owners and the Master of the vessel &amp;lsquo;M&amp;rsquo; for short-delivery of 100 steel coils.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Commissioner of Customs at Mumbai issued a &amp;lsquo;show-cause&amp;quot; notice to the Master and Owners calling upon them to explain why a penalty should not be imposed on them under the provisions of Section 116 [PENALTY FOR NOT ACCOUNTING FOR GOODS] of the Customs Act, 1962.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Discuss with reasons the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a) &amp;lsquo;P&amp;rsquo; was not a party to the contract of carriage, which was made between the shipper and ship-owner-hence, &amp;lsquo;P&amp;rsquo; had no privity to sue the ship-owner/carrier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;b) Because of the tally clerks&amp;rsquo; strike at the load-port, there was a mistake in tallying the steel coils and that whatever was loaded and found on board had been delivered. The number of coils mentioned in the bill of lading was as per the shipper&amp;rsquo;s count. Hence there was no short-delivery to &amp;lsquo;P&amp;rsquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;c) In reply to this show cause notice issued by the Customs, the ship-owners produced records of the strike by the tally clerks as the reason for the mistake in counting and further pleaded that the quantity mentioned in the ship&amp;rsquo;s manifest was as per the shipper&amp;rsquo;s count. Is this a valid defence to avoid penalty under the Customs Act? 30 Marks]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the management level officers on board one of your ships have attended detailed programs on leadership distinguishing all aspects of leadership including transactional, instrumental and transformational leadership.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr &amp;lsquo;Y&amp;rsquo; joined the ship as a 2nd Engineer. After joining the vessel, he soon realized that the Chief Engineer (Mr &amp;lsquo;X&amp;rsquo;) on the vessel had a firm grip on the running of the engine room, which left little room for him to exercise his own authority. Once the initial familiarization period was over, the constant interference&amp;rsquo; by the Chief Engineer in day-to-day matters was becoming irksome to Mr Y. While the junior Engine room staff had got used to &amp;rsquo;toeing-the-line&amp;rsquo;, Mr &amp;lsquo;Y&amp;rsquo; felt restricted in his ability to perform under the constant supervision of the Chief Engineer. Any work-related suggestions from Mr Y to the Chief Engineer were met with the refrain &amp;ldquo;Just do it the way I am telling you&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the first time in his twenty-odd years of sailing, the Chief Engineer felt that he was at a disadvantage&amp;hellip;. not being sure as to how to proceed as in an unexpected burst of aggressiveness, his 2nd Engineer had declined outright to carry out the task assigned to him that day a routine inspection and maintenance work on the Ship&amp;rsquo;s Sewage Treatment Plant (STP).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Chief Engineer Mr X hailed from a family of intellectuals, and was himself a very bright student, with a natural flair for engineering. His up-bringing was in a conservative traditionalist environment, replete with exposure to religious learning, prayer and devotion to the family deities. He was proud of his faith, and started each day with the reciting of verses from the scriptures, in obeisance to the almighty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Professionally, the Chief Engineer Mr X had done well for himself. He distinguished himself academically in the Marine Engineering College from where he graduated, and was fortunate to serve under benevolent senior engineers, who very generously shared their skill and experience. As the years passed, Mr X developed into a skilled Marine Engineer himself, and rapidly moved along the career path to become Chief Engineer at the age of 32 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shore management of the company was very pleased with Mr X&amp;rsquo;s performance as Chief Engineer, that when a temporary position of Marine Superintendent opened up in the shore office, Mr X was invited to fill in. After about 18 months of shore experience as Superintendent, Mr X returned to active sailing on board as Chief Engineer on the same ship which he was superintending earlier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result of his professional pride and his eye for detail, Mr X&amp;rsquo;s style of functioning was very hands-on&amp;quot;. He was involved in every aspect of the machinery operations and maintenance, making all decisions himself and ensuring that the jobs were done to perfection. His departmental staff, though very respectful, was also rather over-dependent on him for handling, of day-to-day matters. His dominant personality had an influence on the rest of the • Blissfully unaware of all this, Mr X was confident of his abilities and felt that he was well in control of things on board. That was till 2nd Engineer Mr Y joined the ship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr Y was a relatively senior 2nd Engineer, also very capable and committed to excellence. He had performed well on previous assignments and was being considered for promotion. Being on this particular ship for the first time, he was keen to pick up the ropes quickly and gain confidence in handling his responsibilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This simmering resentment grew with time, and one fine day things came to a head when the 2nd Engineer was instructed to carry out work on the STP which in his opinion was clearly too dangerous to attempt under the present conditions. The 2nd Engineer put his foot down, mindful that he stood to suffer professionally, as the Chief Engineer would doubtless cite this as a case of insubordination, and initiate disciplinary action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Chief Engineer Mr X was in a bind his bluff had been called. He was aware of the risks associated with the job, but he had got the same job done earlier and felt that the level of risk could be tolerated. However, with the 2nd Engineer&amp;rsquo;s refusal to carry out the job, the Chief Engineer was faced with the prospect of escalating the matter to the Master, or agreeing with the 2nd Engineer&amp;rsquo;s assessment and deferring the task.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The latter would mean loss of face in front of the ER staff, something which the Chief Engineer Mr X would not be able to live with. On the other hand, if the Chief Engineer Mr X took the matter up to the Master, would it not reflect on his inability to control things within his department&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip; his ineffectiveness as a Leader?&lt;/p&gt;

That puts net fleet growth so far for 2019 at 7.5m dwt, which represents capacity expansion from the start of the year of less than 1%. With deliveries running slower than had been expected and scrapping rates high, the combined Capesize and Newcastlemax fleet is actually 1.8m dwt (0.7%) smaller than it was on January 1st. While superficially beneficial for the Cape sector demand/supply balance, the decline is more than offset by the expansion of the VLOC fleet, which despite the removal of 6 ships has seen net capacity growth so far in 2019 of 3.2%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Included in the 11 new deliveries we have seen are six 400k dwt Valemaxes and two 325kdwt Guaibamaxes. There are another 18 VLOCs set to deliver through the remainder of the year as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given that Chinese iron ore imports to the end of April were down 3% year-on-year and there are some obvious constraints on iron ore supply, it is no wonder the Cape market has proved challenging for owners in 2019 so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We do see more iron ore returning to the market from Brazil with the end of the rainy season and the Australian producers are back up to full speed after a poor first quarter, but with another 50 Capes and Newcastlemaxes set for delivery by year-end (not withstanding some slippage) it will take some additional scrapping to help achieve a balance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the smaller sizes the fastest fleet growth has come in the Kamsarmax sector, where capacity has grown by close to 5% this year. Indeed with the Panamax fleet shrinking slightly, total Kamsarmax carrying capacity is for the first time higher than the traditional Panamax fleet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The geared fleet has grown by just over 1% so far this year. Most of the capacity additions have come in the Ultramax and Large Handy (38k dwt) sector where new buildings are almost exclusively focussed. There is almost nothing on order in the other size categories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond the balance of deliveries and ships scrapped, the other key supply side metric is what is being contracted and how the forward order book is changing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the start of the year we had just 67 vessels (9.3m dwt) in the book for delivery in 2021 and just 3 vessels slated for 2022 onwards. It has gone slightly under the radar, but these numbers have jumped in the last few months, with 140 ships (19m dwt) now set for 2021, a more than doubling of orders. Two-thirds of this capacity is in VLOCs and Newcastle axes. However, even with this growth in orders the bulker shipyards look severely underutilised for 2021. They are currently on course for their lowest output since 2003, with little time remaining to fill up the gap.&lt;/p&gt;

[50 Marks]
Case Report:
All the management level officers on board one of your ships have attended detailed programs on leadership distinguishing all aspects of leadership including transactional, instrumental and transformational leadership.
Mr &amp;lsquo;Y&amp;rsquo; joined the ship as a 2nd Engineer. After joining the vessel, he soon realized that the Chief Engineer (Mr &amp;lsquo;X&amp;rsquo;) on the vessel had a firm grip on the running of the engine room, which left little room for him to exercise his own authority. Once the initial &amp;lsquo;familiarization&amp;rsquo; period was over, the constant &amp;lsquo;interference&amp;rsquo; by the Chief Engineer in day-to-day matters was becoming irksome to Mr Y. While the junior Engine room staff had got used to &amp;rsquo;toeing-the-line&amp;rsquo;, Mr &amp;lsquo;Y&amp;rsquo; felt restricted in his ability to perform under the constant supervision of the Chief Engineer. Any work-related suggestions from Mr Y to the Chief Engineer were met with the refrain &amp;ldquo;Just do it the way I am telling you&amp;rdquo;.
For the first time in his twenty-odd years of sailing, the Chief Engineer felt that he was at a disadvantage&amp;hellip;. not being sure as to how to proceed as in an unexpected burst of aggressiveness, his 2nd Engineer had declined outright to carry out the task assigned to him that day a routine inspection and maintenance work on the Ship&amp;rsquo;s Sewage Treatment Plant (STP).
The Chief Engineer Mr X hailed from a family of intellectuals, and was himself a very bright student, with a natural flair for engineering. His up-bringing was in a conservative traditionalist environment, replete with exposure to religious learning, prayer and devotion to the family deities. He was proud of his faith, and started each day with the reciting of verses from the scriptures, in obeisance to the almighty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Professionally, the Chief Engineer Mr. X had done well for himself. He distinguished himself academically in the Marine Engineering College from where he graduated, and was fortunate to serve under benevolent senior engineers, who very generously shared their skill and experience. As the years passed, Mr X developed into a skilled Marine Engineer himself, and rapidly moved along the career path to become Chief Engineer at the age of 32 years.
1 • The shore management of the company was very pleased with Mr X&amp;rsquo;s performance as Chief Engineer, that when a temporary position of Marine Superintendent opened up in the shore office, Mr X was invited to fill in. After about 18 months of shore experience as Superintendent, Mr X returned to active sailing on board as Chief Engineer on the same ship which he was superintending earlier.
As a result of his professional pride and his eye for detail, Mr X&amp;rsquo;s style of functioning was very &amp;lsquo;hands-on&amp;rsquo;. He was involved in every aspect of the machinery operations and maintenance, making all decisions himself and ensuring that the jobs were done to perfection. His departmental staff, though very respectful, was also rather over-dependent on him for handling of day-to-day matters. His dominant personality had an influence on the rest of the ship&amp;rsquo;s crew to the extent that the Master and Chief Officer felt insecure at times when interacting with him.
Blissfully unaware of all this, Mr X was confident of his abilities and felt that he was well in control of things on board. That was till 2nd Engineer Mr Y joined the ship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr Y was a relatively senior 2nd Engineer, also very capable and committed to excellence. He had performed well on previous assignments and was being considered for promotion. Being on this particular ship for the first time, he was keen to pick up the ropes quickly and gain confidence in handling his responsibilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This simmering resentment grew with time, and one fine day things came to a head when the 2nd Engineer was instructed to carry out work on the STP which in his opinion was clearly too dangerous to attempt under the present conditions. The 2nd Engineer put his foot down, mindful that he stood to suffer professionally, as the Chief Engineer would doubtless cite this as a case of insubordination, and initiate disciplinary action.
The Chief Engineer Mr X was in a bind - his bluff had been called. He was aware of the risks associated with the job, but he had got the same job done earlier and felt that the level of risk could be tolerated. However, with the 2nd Engineer&amp;rsquo;s refusal to carry out the job, the Chief Engineer was faced with the prospect of escalating the matter to the Master, or agreeing with the 2nd Engineer&amp;rsquo;s assessment and deferring the task.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The latter would mean loss of face in front of the ER staff, something which the Chief Engineer Mr X would not be able to live with. On the other hand, if the Chief Engineer Mr X took the matter up to the Master, would it not reflect on his inability to control things within his department.. his ineffectiveness as a Leader&lt;/p&gt;

1.Q. Case Study:
President Biden made it clear throughout his election campaign that he planned to re-engage with Iran, Iran and the US took the first public steps to re-engage with each other. Nevertheless, the &amp;ldquo;talks&amp;rdquo; were said to be constructive with further &amp;ldquo;discussions&amp;rdquo; scheduled to take place on the 9th of April.
Tanker supply still looks benign despite a recent flurry of VLCC orders.2023 delivery is said to be closed for VLCCs after an ordering spree of 15,000-teu and larger boxships which compete for the same dock space. In absolute terms, on an annualised basis, the total tanker order book of 54.26m-dwt in 2020 was last lower than this in 2001, when it was at 50.92m-dwt.The 2020 OB/FL ratio for all tankers fell to an historic low of just 8.7% which bodes well as oil demand recovers and returns to trend growth. Despite tanker scrap prices of $460+, tanker demolition has been disappointing. A pick-up in March saw 10 21 tanker scrapping come in at 29/1.98 m-dwt after 17/2.00m-dwt in 4Q 20.In the previous three quarters of 2020 only 32/1.70m-dwt was dispatched. The ISC scrap yards are being hampered by Covid lockdowns while also being outbid by shady buyers in sunny places. Large crude tankers are being bought for further trading, to be deployed in subterfuge trades involving Iranian and Venezuelan oil. US rapprochement with Iran may lead to the NITC fleet becoming more visibly active but, in reality, it is already fully employed in storage and discreet deliveries to Asian buyers. If Biden does a deal then the subterfuge trades will die and those tankers will head for the beaches.
Questions:
Why are sanction of the US against Iran a game changer?
A. Why does the scrapping of tankers hinging on the trade relations between US and Iran?
B. What will be impact of the NITC fleet coming to the water?
C. Why is there an extensive order of large box ships and why does this have an impact on the VLCC orders?

Q1. Read the case study or d&amp;rsquo; answer the questions
Ching&amp;rsquo;s seaterse teen ore-buports last your accoumed for over 70% of global imperis 1,047mt out of 1,476mt. But the 2018 import total was 1% down on 2017, the first year on-year decline since 2010, when the country&amp;rsquo;s imparts fell 1.5% to 619mt from 628 min 2009
The latest Dry Bulk Trades qutlook forecasts for the country indicates flat import thi sear of 1,048nt, down 1.5% from its early January estimate of 1.064mt. The tom shortfall represents a combination of lower available iron ore supply and weaker in ore import demand.
The situation in the said country is that steel prices have fallen, while raw material input cats have tisen, leading to an untenable squeeze on sizel mill margins.
in In January/February this year, the country imported 174.4mt of iron ore, down 5.5% on the 184.6mt that it imported in the same period last year. There is the distortional impact of the lunar new-year holidays, when steel mills and traders shut down for up to tow weeks. and the impact of rising iron ore prices as availability shrank in 1st quarter.
62% Fe, CPR China iron ore prices rose 24% from $74.6pmt on 25 January to $92.3pm on 7 February. They then dipped to a low of $84.5pmt on 11 March before recovering to, $92.2pmt yesterday. Prices averaged under $70 a tonne in 2018.
When prices rise. buyers in that country buy less, draw down their port and other stocks. switch to lower grade imports, and use inferior quality and cheaper domestic supplies. Some blast furnace output is replaced by electric are furnaces that use steel serap as feedstock. The end result is lower iron ore demand, and higher imports from nearby country at the expense of long-haul imports: a tonne-mile loss. This is disastrous cocktail for capesize bulk carriers.
Through the fog of distorting factors, it is hard to assess what is temporary and what is structural. Import tariffs raise prices for households and reduce discretionary spending
The countries slower economic growth. 6.6% last year and possibly 6.3% this year, are the lowest rates of GDP growth in the last 30 years. The country is transitioning to lesser levels of industrial and manufacturing intensity as it tackles pollution, outsources functions to Southeast Asia and reduces over-capacity as it rolls out and supports its Belt and Road Initiative. In industrial terms. it is a progressive switch from heavy industry to light industry as services grow. Capes and other bulk carriers were expected to benefit from a supply-led rather than a demand-led recopury this year. We anticipated low levels of tonnage supply and robest demand andels, but Q&amp;rsquo;s events roquire the forecasts to he adjusted down a bit, Assunt, we have witnessed mass panic as a series of what should be temporary events have hijackad sentlicht and confidence. This quickly depresses freight rates, santings and values,

EM 103 5/6/24
Q.1.a) Mr &amp;lsquo;P&amp;rsquo; was working as chief officer on a Panama registered merchant ship. He was the only member of the crew on that ship with Indian nationality. As the Chief Officer of the ship, he had to direct the crew for various jobs on board and often had arguments with them.
Mr &amp;lsquo;P&amp;rsquo; was reported missing from the ship when she was in international waters. After Mr &amp;lsquo;P&amp;rsquo;s disappearance, the ship called at Singapore and Colombo but the Master reported that he had no reason to suspect foul play and that Mr &amp;lsquo;P&amp;rsquo; went missing at sea.
Thereafter the vessel called at Mumbai. Mr &amp;lsquo;P&amp;rsquo;s father then filed a report with the police stating that he has reason to believe his son was murdered and calling upon the Mumbai police to investigate the crime. Mr P&amp;rsquo;s father produced letters and emails received from Mr P showing that there was constant friction between him and some of the crew members who had threatened to kill him and that Mr &amp;lsquo;P&amp;rsquo; was fearful about his life.
The ship-owner says that since the alleged crime did not take place in Indian Territory, the Indian authorities have no jurisdiction to investigate the allegations made by Mr P&amp;rsquo;s father. Discuss the merits and demerits of the ship-owner&amp;rsquo;s contention. [30 marks]

Q.2 The general cargo vessel &amp;lsquo;M&amp;rsquo; loaded steel coils in Marseilles. The loading process was spread over several days and for some time during this period. there was a strike by the tally clerks, but loading of steel coils was not interrupted. On completion of loading, the Shipper informed the Master that 15,000 coils of steel, each weighing 2 tons had been loaded on board. The Master issued a clean Bill of Lading for 15,000 coils stating &amp;ldquo;Shipper&amp;rsquo;s load. stow and count: 15000 coils, said to weigh 2 tons each&amp;rdquo;. The &amp;ldquo;Bill of Lading incorporated the Hague Visby Rules. The shipper endorsed the bill of lading to &amp;ldquo;P&amp;rdquo; the purchaser of the steel coils who paid the full price of 15,000 steel coils and to whom the property in the steel coils was transferred.
At Mumbai the designated port of discharge, only 14,900 steel coils were found on board and were delivered to &amp;ldquo;P&amp;rdquo;. “P” sued the owners and the Master of the vessel &amp;lsquo;M&amp;rsquo; for short-delivery of 100 steel coils.
The Commissioner of Customs at Mumbai issued a &amp;lsquo;show-cause&amp;rdquo; notice to the Master and Owners calling upon them to explain why a penalty should not be imposed on them under the provisions of Section 116 (PENALTY FOR NOT ACCOUNTING FOR GOODS] of the Customs Act. 1962.
Discuss with reasons the following:
a) P&amp;rsquo; was not a party to the contract of carriage, which was made between the shipper and ship-owner hence. &amp;ldquo;P&amp;rdquo; had no privity to sue the ship-owner/carrier.
b) Because of the tally clerks strike at the load-port, there was a mistake in tallying the steel coils and that whatever was loaded and found on board had been delivered. The number of coils mentioned in the bill of lading was as per the shipper&amp;rsquo;s count. Hence there was no short-delivery to &amp;ldquo;P&amp;rdquo;
c) In reply to this show cause notice issued by the Customs, the ship-owners produced records of the strike by the tally clerks as the reason for the mistake in counting and further pleaded that the quantity mentioned in the ship&amp;rsquo;s manifest was as per the shipper&amp;rsquo;s count. Is this a valid defence to avoid penalty under the Customs Act?

One seafarer on board the vessel used a firearm to quel the attack and one of the attackers died. The Malaysian Coast Guard intercepted the vessel shortly thereafter and took into custody all the seafarers on board the vessel. Subsequently, the seafarer who had shot the firearm was charged for murder of a &amp;ldquo;fisherman&amp;rdquo; and sought to be tried in the Malaysian courts. The Indian government argued that the attackers were pirates and not fisherman, and that any trial against Indian seafarers, if at all, must be conducted in India alone.&lt;/p&gt;
