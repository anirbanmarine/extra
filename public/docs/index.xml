      <description>
        
        
        &lt;p&gt;Agenda 21 is a comprehensive plan of action to achieve sustainable development. It was adopted by 178 governments at the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED) in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, in 1992. Agenda 21 is a non-binding document, but it has been influential in guiding sustainable development efforts around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Agenda 21 covers a wide range of issues, including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sustainable agriculture and rural development
Conservation of biological diversity
Combating deforestation
Protecting the atmosphere
Managing fragile ecosystems
Promoting sustainable energy use
Managing hazardous wastes
Promoting sustainable human settlements
Agenda 21 also emphasizes the importance of international cooperation and participation of all stakeholders in achieving sustainable development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The UNFCCC Agenda 21 is a subset of Agenda 21 that specifically addresses climate change. It outlines a series of actions that countries can take to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and adapt to the impacts of climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The UNFCCC Agenda 21 includes provisions for:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Developed countries to provide financial and technological assistance to developing countries to help them mitigate and adapt to climate change
All countries to develop national climate change action plans
Countries to cooperate in developing and implementing international climate change policies
The UNFCCC Agenda 21 has been influential in shaping the international response to climate change. It has helped to raise awareness of the issue and has provided a framework for international cooperation on climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Current status of the UNFCCC Agenda 21&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The UNFCCC Agenda 21 is still relevant today. The world is still facing significant challenges in addressing climate change, and the UNFCCC Agenda 21 provides a roadmap for how to address these challenges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Countries are making progress in implementing the UNFCCC Agenda 21, but more needs to be done. Developed countries need to provide more financial and technological assistance to developing countries, and all countries need to do more to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and adapt to the impacts of climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Significance of the UNFCCC Agenda 21&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The UNFCCC Agenda 21 is a significant document because it provides a comprehensive framework for addressing climate change. It is also significant because it was adopted by consensus by all UNFCCC member states, which shows that there is a strong international commitment to addressing climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The UNFCCC Agenda 21 has been influential in shaping the international response to climate change. It has helped to raise awareness of the issue and has provided a framework for international cooperation on climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The UNFCCC Agenda 21 is still relevant today, and countries need to continue to implement its provisions in order to address the challenges of climate change.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Kyoto Protocol-UNFCCC (UNFCCC,Kyoto,1997)</title>
      <link>https://www.anirbanmarine.in/docs/partc/em301/intconv/kyotoproto/</link>

      <description>
        
        
        &lt;p&gt;The Kyoto Protocol is an international treaty that was adopted in 1997 at the Third Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in Kyoto, Japan. It entered into force in 2005 and has been ratified by 192 countries, including India.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Kyoto Protocol is the first international treaty to set binding targets for the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. It commits developed countries to reduce their emissions by an average of 5.2% below 1990 levels by the first commitment period, 2008-2012.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Kyoto Protocol includes a number of mechanisms to help countries achieve their emissions targets, including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Emissions trading: Countries can trade emissions permits with each other, so that countries that can reduce their emissions more cheaply can sell permits to countries that find it more difficult or expensive to reduce their emissions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Joint implementation: Countries can work together to implement projects that reduce emissions in other countries.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Clean development mechanism: Developed countries can invest in projects that reduce emissions in developing countries, and then count the emissions reductions towards their own targets.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Kyoto Protocol has played an important role in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and promoting international cooperation on climate change. However, it has also been criticized for not being ambitious enough and for not including all major emitters, such as the United States.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some of the key achievements of the Kyoto Protocol:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Kyoto Protocol has helped to raise awareness of the importance of reducing greenhouse gas emissions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Kyoto Protocol has established a global framework for international cooperation on climate change.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Kyoto Protocol has promoted the development of new technologies and markets for clean energy and energy efficiency.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Kyoto Protocol has helped to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from developed countries.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Kyoto Protocol is an important tool for addressing climate change. However, it is important to note that the first commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol ended in 2012 and that a new agreement, the Paris Agreement, was adopted in 2015. The Paris Agreement sets out a new framework for international cooperation on climate change, with the goal of limiting the global temperature rise to well below 2 degrees Celsius, preferably to 1.5 degrees Celsius, compared to pre-industrial levels.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <description>
        
        
        &lt;p&gt;The Regional Seas Programme (RSP) is a global partnership of 14 Regional Seas Conventions and Action Plans (RSCAPs) that work to protect and manage the marine and coastal environment. The RSP is coordinated by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and is funded by a variety of sources, including governments, international organizations, and the private sector.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The RSP was launched in 1974 at the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment in Stockholm. The first RSCAP was established in the Mediterranean Sea in 1976, and since then, RSCAPs have been established in all major ocean regions around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The RSP takes an ecosystem-based approach to marine and coastal management. This means that it takes into account the interconnectedness of all components of the marine and coastal environment, including humans. The RSP works to protect and manage the marine and coastal environment through a variety of activities, including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Developing and implementing regional action plans to address specific marine and coastal environmental problems
Providing technical assistance and capacity building to developing countries
Promoting public awareness and education about marine and coastal environmental issues
Facilitating cooperation and coordination between different stakeholders
The RSP has played a significant role in protecting and managing the marine and coastal environment. It has helped to reduce pollution, protect biodiversity, and promote sustainable development in coastal communities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Paris 2015, the RSP was recognized as an important tool for implementing the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The SDGs are a set of 17 goals adopted by all United Nations Member States in 2015 as a blueprint to achieve a better and more sustainable future for all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The RSP is particularly relevant to the following SDGs:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SDG 6: Ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all
SDG 14: Conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources for sustainable development
SDG 15: Protect, restore and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, and halt and reverse land degradation and halt biodiversity loss
The RSP is committed to working with all stakeholders to implement the SDGs and achieve a more sustainable future for the marine and coastal environment.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;##Rio+10&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 2002 World Summit on Sustainable Development (WSSD), also known as Rio+10, was held in Johannesburg, South Africa, from 26 August to 4 September 2002. It was a follow-up to the 1992 Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Rio+10 Summit was attended by over 100 heads of state and government, as well as representatives from civil society and the private sector. It focused on the implementation of the outcomes of the 1992 Earth Summit, and on identifying new challenges and opportunities for sustainable development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Rio+10 Summit produced a number of outcomes, including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Johannesburg Declaration on Sustainable Development, which reaffirmed the commitment of world leaders to sustainable development and set out a number of goals and targets to be achieved by 2015.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Plan of Implementation, which provided a detailed blueprint for implementing the Johannesburg Declaration.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Type II Partnerships, which were voluntary agreements between governments, businesses, and civil society organizations to work together on specific sustainable development projects.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Rio+10 Summit was a significant event in the history of sustainable development. It helped to raise awareness of the importance of sustainable development and to mobilize global action on the issue. However, it is important to note that many of the goals and targets set at the Rio+10 Summit were not achieved, and that the world still faces a number of challenges in achieving sustainable development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;##Rio+20&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 2012 United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development (UNCSD), also known as Rio+20, was held in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, from 20 to 22 June 2012. It was a follow-up to the 1992 Earth Summit and the 2002 Rio+10 Summit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Rio+20 Conference was attended by over 100 heads of state and government, as well as representatives from civil society and the private sector. It focused on the following three themes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Green economy in the context of sustainable development and poverty eradication.
Institutional framework for sustainable development.
The new challenges of sustainable development.
The Rio+20 Conference produced a number of outcomes, including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Future We Want, an outcome document that reaffirmed the commitment of world leaders to sustainable development and set out a number of goals and targets to be achieved.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The 10-Year Framework of Programmes on Sustainable Consumption and Production Patterns (10YFP), which provided a framework for international cooperation on sustainable consumption and production.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Intergovernmental Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES), an independent intergovernmental body to assess the state of biodiversity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Rio+20 Conference was a significant event in the history of sustainable development. It helped to renew the commitment of world leaders to sustainable development and to lay the foundation for a new era of sustainable development. However, it is important to note that many of the goals and targets set at the Rio+20 Conference have not yet been achieved, and that the world still faces a number of challenges in achieving sustainable development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Legacy of Rio+10 and Rio+20&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;legacy-of-rio10-and-rio20&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#legacy-of-rio10-and-rio20&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Rio+10 and Rio+20 Summits were important events in the history of sustainable development. They helped to raise awareness of the importance of sustainable development, to mobilize global action on the issue, and to lay the foundation for a new era of sustainable development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, it is important to note that many of the goals and targets set at the Rio+10 and Rio+20 Summits have not yet been achieved. The world still faces a number of challenges in achieving sustainable development, including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Poverty and inequality&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Climate change&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Biodiversity loss&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pollution&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Resource scarcity
Despite these challenges, there is also a growing awareness of the importance of sustainable development and a growing commitment to achieving it. The Rio+10 and Rio+20 Summits played an important role in promoting sustainable development, and their legacy continues to inspire people around the world to work towards a more sustainable future.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <description>
        
        
        &lt;p&gt;The Commission on Sustainable Development (CSD) was a functional commission of the United Nations Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) that was established in 1992 following the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro. The CSD was tasked with reviewing the implementation of Agenda 21, the global plan for sustainable development that was adopted at the Earth Summit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Global Environment Facility (GEF) is an international financial institution that was established in 1992 to provide &amp;gt;funding for projects that address global environmental problems. The GEF is one of the financial mechanisms of the CSD, &amp;gt;and it plays an important role in supporting the implementation of Agenda 21.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The GEF provides funding for projects in a number of areas, including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Climate change&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Biodiversity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;International waters&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Land degradation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Chemicals and waste&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Persistent organic pollutants (POPs)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The GEF works with a variety of partners, including governments, civil society organizations, and the private sector, to implement its projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CSD was abolished in 2013 and its functions were transferred to the High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF). The HLPF is the global forum for reviewing the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The GEF continues to play an important role in supporting the implementation of the SDGs. It is the largest provider of grants to developing countries for environmental projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some examples of how the GEF has supported the implementation of Agenda 21:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The GEF has provided funding for projects to protect and restore forests, which play an important role in mitigating climate change and conserving biodiversity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The GEF has provided funding for projects to improve water quality and management, which is essential for human health and sustainable development.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The GEF has provided funding for projects to reduce pollution and protect the environment from hazardous chemicals and waste.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The GEF is a key partner in the global effort to achieve sustainable development. It plays an important role in supporting the implementation of Agenda 21 and the SDGs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>The Intergovernmental Conference on biological diversity beyond national jurisdiction (BBNJ,2023)</title>
      <link>https://www.anirbanmarine.in/docs/partc/em301/intconv/bbnj/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>
        
        
        &lt;p&gt;The Intergovernmental Conference on biological diversity beyond national jurisdiction (BBNJ) concluded on June 19, 2023, with the adoption of a landmark agreement to conserve and sustainably use marine biodiversity in areas beyond national jurisdiction (ABNJ). The agreement, which was adopted by consensus by the 193 member states of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), is the first comprehensive international treaty to address marine biodiversity in ABNJ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The BBNJ agreement covers a wide range of issues, including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Marine protected areas (MPAs): The agreement establishes a process for establishing and managing MPAs in ABNJ, including large-scale MPAs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Environmental impact assessments (EIAs): The agreement requires EIAs to be conducted for all activities that have the potential to significantly impact marine biodiversity in ABNJ.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Capacity building and technology transfer: The agreement includes provisions to help developing countries build their capacity to implement the agreement and to gain access to relevant technologies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The BBNJ agreement is a significant achievement for the conservation of marine biodiversity. It is estimated that ABNJ accounts for over half of the Earth&amp;rsquo;s surface and is home to a vast array of marine life, much of which is still unknown to science. The agreement will help to protect this biodiversity from the growing threats of climate change, overfishing, and pollution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Current status of the BBNJ agreement&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;current-status-of-the-bbnj-agreement&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#current-status-of-the-bbnj-agreement&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of October 1, 2023, the BBNJ agreement has been signed by 92 countries and regional economic integration organizations. However, it has not yet been ratified by any country.&lt;/p&gt;

It is the first comprehensive international treaty to address marine biodiversity in ABNJ, which covers over half of the Earth&amp;rsquo;s surface. The agreement will help to protect this biodiversity from the growing threats of climate change, overfishing, and pollution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The BBNJ agreement is also significant because it was adopted by consensus by the 193 member states of UNCLOS. This shows that there is a strong international commitment to conserving marine biodiversity in ABNJ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Next steps&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;next-steps&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#next-steps&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next step for the BBNJ agreement is for countries to ratify it. Once 30 countries have ratified the agreement, it will enter into force.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Countries are encouraged to ratify the BBNJ agreement as soon as possible to ensure that its benefits can be realized as soon as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>
        
        
        &lt;p&gt;The London Convention on the Prevention of Marine Pollution by Dumping of Wastes and Other Matter (LC 1972) is a global treaty adopted in 1972 to protect the marine environment from human activities, including the dumping of wastes. The Convention entered into force in 1975 and currently has 87 Contracting Parties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The London Convention prohibits the dumping of certain hazardous materials, such as organohalogen compounds, mercury, cadmium, persistent plastics, and radioactive wastes. It also requires a prior special permit for the dumping of certain other materials, such as industrial wastes and dredged material.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1996, the London Protocol was adopted to further modernize the Convention and, eventually, replace it. The Protocol prohibits all dumping, except for possibly acceptable wastes on the so-called &amp;ldquo;reverse list&amp;rdquo;. The London Protocol entered into force in 2006 and currently has 52 Contracting Parties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The London Convention and Protocol play an important role in protecting the marine environment from pollution caused by dumping. By prohibiting or regulating the dumping of certain wastes, the Conventions help to ensure that the oceans remain clean and healthy for future generations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some of the key achievements of the London Convention and Protocol:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The dumping of radioactive wastes at sea has been banned since 1993.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The dumping of industrial wastes at sea was phased out by 1995.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The incineration of wastes at sea has been banned since 1994.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The dumping of persistent plastics at sea has been prohibited since 2010.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The London Convention and Protocol have helped to reduce the amount of marine debris, such as plastic bags and bottles, in the oceans.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Conventions have also helped to improve the quality of seawater and seabed sediments in many parts of the world.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The London Convention and Protocol are important tools for protecting the marine environment from pollution caused by dumping. By working together, the Contracting Parties to the Conventions can help to ensure that the oceans remain clean and healthy for all.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED),1992</title>
      <link>https://www.anirbanmarine.in/docs/partc/em301/intconv/unced/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>
        
        
        &lt;p&gt;The United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED), also known as the Earth Summit, was a major United Nations conference held in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, from June 3 to 14, 1992. It was the largest gathering of world leaders as of 1992, with 117 heads of state and representatives of 178 nations in all attending.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Earth Summit was convened in recognition of the growing interdependence of the environment and development. It was a landmark event in the history of international environmental cooperation, and it produced a number of important agreements, including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Rio Declaration on Environment and Development, which sets out 27 principles for sustainable development, including the principle that &amp;ldquo;human beings are at the centre of concerns for sustainable development.&amp;rdquo;
The Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), which is the main international treaty for addressing climate change.
The Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), which is the main international treaty for addressing the loss of biodiversity.
Agenda 21, a comprehensive plan for sustainable development that covers a wide range of issues, including poverty, hunger, health, education, and environmental protection.
The Earth Summit was a major step forward in international environmental cooperation, but it is important to note that the agreements it produced are not legally binding. This means that countries are not obligated to implement them, but they do provide a framework for international action on sustainable development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Earth Summit also had a significant impact on public awareness of environmental issues. It helped to put sustainable development on the global agenda and to inspire people around the world to take action to protect the environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 30th anniversary of the Earth Summit will be celebrated in 2022. This is an opportunity to reflect on the progress that has been made in the past 30 years and to identify the challenges that remain. It is also an opportunity to renew our commitment to sustainable development and to build a better future for all.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD,Rio,1992) </title>
      <link>https://www.anirbanmarine.in/docs/partc/em301/intconv/unconvbiodiversity/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>
        
        
        &lt;p&gt;The United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) is an international treaty that aims to promote sustainable development. It was adopted at the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro in 1992 and has been ratified by 196 countries, including India.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CBD has three main objectives:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The conservation of biological diversity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The sustainable use of its components.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The fair and equitable sharing of the benefits arising from the use of genetic resources.
The CBD is a comprehensive treaty that covers all aspects of biological diversity, from ecosystems to species to genes. It also covers biotechnology and the fair and equitable sharing of benefits from the use of genetic resources.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CBD is implemented through a number of mechanisms, including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;National Biodiversity Strategies and Action Plans (NBSAPs): NBSAPs are national plans that outline how each country will implement the CBD.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Conference of the Parties (COP): The COP is the supreme decision-making body of the CBD. It meets every two years to review the implementation of the Convention and to make decisions on new initiatives.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Subsidiary Body on Scientific, Technical and Technological Advice (SBSTTA): SBSTTA is a scientific advisory body that provides advice to the COP on scientific, technical, and technological matters related to the CBD.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Subsidiary Body on Implementation (SBI): SBI is an implementation advisory body that provides advice to the COP on the implementation of the CBD.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The CBD has played an important role in promoting the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity around the world. However, there are still a number of challenges that need to be addressed, such as the loss of biodiversity due to habitat loss, climate change, and invasive species.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some of the key achievements of the CBD:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The CBD has helped to raise awareness of the importance of biological diversity and the need to protect it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The CBD has promoted the development of national biodiversity strategies and action plans, which have helped to guide countries in their efforts to conserve and sustainably use biological diversity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The CBD has established a number of mechanisms for international cooperation on biological diversity, such as the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) and the Clearing-House Mechanism.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The CBD has helped to promote the fair and equitable sharing of benefits from the use of genetic resources.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The CBD is an important tool for protecting biological diversity and promoting sustainable development. It is essential that all parties continue to work together to implement the Convention effectively.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC,Rio,1992)</title>
      <link>https://www.anirbanmarine.in/docs/partc/em301/intconv/unfccc/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>
        
        
        &lt;p&gt;The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) is an international treaty that was adopted in 1992 at the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. It entered into force in 1994 and has been ratified by 198 countries, including India.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The UNFCCC is a landmark agreement that sets out the global framework for addressing climate change. It recognizes that climate change is a common concern of humankind and that all countries have a responsibility to address it. However, it also acknowledges that countries have different capabilities and responsibilities in addressing climate change, and that developed countries should take the lead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The UNFCCC has two main objectives:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To stabilize greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To achieve this objective within a time-frame sufficient to allow ecosystems to adapt naturally to climate change, to ensure that food production is not threatened and to enable economic development to proceed in a sustainable manner.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The UNFCCC is implemented through a number of mechanisms, including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;National communications: Parties to the UNFCCC are required to submit national communications on a regular basis. These communications provide information on greenhouse gas emissions, mitigation and adaptation measures, and financial and technological needs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Conference of the Parties (COP): The COP is the supreme decision-making body of the UNFCCC. It meets every year to review the implementation of the Convention and to make decisions on new initiatives.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Subsidiary Body on Scientific, Technical and Technological Advice (SBSTA): SBSTA is a scientific advisory body that provides advice to the COP on scientific, technical, and technological matters related to the UNFCCC.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Subsidiary Body on Implementation (SBI): SBI is an implementation advisory body that provides advice to the COP on the implementation of the UNFCCC.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The UNFCCC has played an important role in promoting international cooperation on climate change. However, there are still a number of challenges that need to be addressed, such as reducing greenhouse gas emissions to limit the global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius, and providing financial and technological support to developing countries to help them adapt to the impacts of climate change.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some of the key achievements of the UNFCCC:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The UNFCCC has helped to raise awareness of the importance of climate change and the need to address it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The UNFCCC has established a global framework for international cooperation on climate change.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The UNFCCC has promoted the development of national climate change policies and plans.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The UNFCCC has helped to mobilize financial and technological resources to support developing countries in their efforts to mitigate and adapt to climate change.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The UNFCCC is an important tool for addressing climate change. It is essential that all parties continue to work together to implement the Convention effectively.&lt;/li&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;The United Nations Conference on the Human Environment, also known as the Stockholm Conference, was held in Stockholm, Sweden, from June 5-16, 1972. It was the first major international conference to address environmental issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The conference was attended by representatives from 113 countries, and resulted in the adoption of the Stockholm Declaration, an Action Plan for the Human Environment, and several resolutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Stockholm Declaration is a landmark document in environmental law. It contains 26 principles that outline the rights and responsibilities of states in protecting the environment. Some of the key principles of the Stockholm Declaration include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Man has the fundamental right to freedom, equality and adequate conditions of life, in an environment of a quality that permits a life of dignity and well-being.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;States have, in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations and the principles of international law, the sovereign right to exploit their own resources pursuant to their own environmental policies, and the responsibility to ensure that activities within their jurisdiction or control do not cause damage to the environment of other States or of areas beyond the limits of national jurisdiction.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The natural resources of the earth, including air, water, land, flora and fauna and especially representative samples of natural ecosystems, must be safeguarded for the benefit of present and future generations through careful planning or management, as appropriate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Action Plan for the Human Environment is a comprehensive document that sets out a series of recommendations for addressing environmental problems at the national and international levels. The plan includes recommendations on a wide range of issues, including pollution control, natural resource management, and environmental education.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Stockholm Conference was a watershed moment in the global environmental movement. It helped to raise awareness of environmental problems and to promote international cooperation in addressing them. The principles and recommendations of the Stockholm Conference continue to guide environmental policy and law around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Significance of the United Nations Convention on Human Environment, 1972&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;The United Nations Convention on Human Environment, 1972, was a landmark event in the history of environmental protection. It was the first major international conference to address environmental issues, and it resulted in the adoption of a number of important documents, including the Stockholm Declaration and the Action Plan for the Human Environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Stockholm Declaration is a landmark document in environmental law. It contains 26 principles that outline the rights and responsibilities of states in protecting the environment. The principles of the Stockholm Declaration have been incorporated into many other international environmental agreements and national environmental laws.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Action Plan for the Human Environment is a comprehensive document that sets out a series of recommendations for addressing environmental problems at the national and international levels. The plan includes recommendations on a wide range of issues, including pollution control, natural resource management, and environmental education.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United Nations Convention on Human Environment, 1972, was a watershed moment in the global environmental movement. It helped to lay the foundation for the development of international environmental law and policy. The conference also helped to raise awareness of environmental problems and to promote international cooperation in addressing them.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Tides can be classified in a number of ways, including by frequency, range, and type.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Frequency&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;frequency&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#frequency&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tides can be classified by frequency based on the number of high and low tides that occur each day. The three main types of tidal frequencies are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Diurnal tides:&lt;/strong&gt; One high tide and one low tide per day.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Semi-diurnal tides:&lt;/strong&gt; Two high tides and two low tides per day.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mixed tides:&lt;/strong&gt; A combination of diurnal and semi-diurnal tides, with the number of high and low tides varying per day.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Range&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;range&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#range&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tides can also be classified by range, which is the difference in height between the high and low tides. The three main types of tidal ranges are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Microtidal tides:&lt;/strong&gt; A range of less than 2 meters.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mesotidal tides:&lt;/strong&gt; A range of 2 to 4 meters.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Macrotidal tides:&lt;/strong&gt; A range of more than 4 meters.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Type&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;type&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#type&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tides can also be classified by type, based on the forces that cause them. The three main types of tides are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Astronomical tides:&lt;/strong&gt; Caused by the gravitational pull of the moon and the sun.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meteorological tides:&lt;/strong&gt; Caused by atmospheric pressure changes and winds.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Seiches:&lt;/strong&gt; Caused by the resonant oscillation of water in enclosed or semi-enclosed bodies of water, such as lakes and bays.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Examples&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;examples&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#examples&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here are some examples of different types of tides:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Diurnal tides:&lt;/strong&gt; Diurnal tides are common in the tropics, where the moon passes overhead twice a day.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Semi-diurnal tides:&lt;/strong&gt; Semi-diurnal tides are common in temperate and polar regions, where the moon passes overhead once a day.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mixed tides:&lt;/strong&gt; Mixed tides are found in many coastal areas, where the shape of the coastline and the ocean basin can affect the frequency of the tides.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Microtidal tides:&lt;/strong&gt; Microtidal tides are found along most of the coast of California.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mesotidal tides:&lt;/strong&gt; Mesotidal tides are found along most of the coast of the United States, as well as along the coasts of Europe and Asia.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Macrotidal tides:&lt;/strong&gt; Macrotidal tides are found along the coast of Canada, the Bay of Fundy, and the coast of Patagonia.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Astronomical tides:&lt;/strong&gt; Astronomical tides are the most common type of tide. They are caused by the gravitational pull of the moon and the sun.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meteorological tides:&lt;/strong&gt; Meteorological tides are less common than astronomical tides. They are caused by atmospheric pressure changes and winds.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Seiches:&lt;/strong&gt; Seiches are rare, but they can occur in enclosed or semi-enclosed bodies of water, such as lakes and bays.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tides are a complex phenomenon that is influenced by a variety of factors. However, the classification of tides by frequency, range, and type can help us to better understand and predict the tides.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Here is a summary of the main places of origin, trade routes, and seasonal variations of important cargoes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Cargo&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Main places of origin&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Trade routes&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Seasonal variations&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Crude oil&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Middle East, Russia, United States, Canada, Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Iran, Kuwait, Venezuela,   Nigeria&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Asia, Europe, North America, South America&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Demand for crude oil is relatively constant throughout the year, but there can be fluctuations due to factors such as economic growth, weather events, and geopolitical tensions.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Iron ore&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Australia, Brazil, China, India, Russia	China, Japan, South Korea, Europe&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Demand for iron ore is seasonal, with higher demand in the second half of the year as steel mills prepare for the winter construction season.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Coal&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Australia, Indonesia, Russia, United States, China&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;China, Japan, South Korea, India, Europe&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Demand for coal is seasonal, with higher demand in the winter months for heating and power generation.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Grain&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;United States, Argentina, Brazil, Russia, Ukraine, Canada, Australia&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;China, Japan, South Korea, Europe, Middle East, Africa&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Demand for grain is relatively constant throughout the year, but there can be fluctuations due to factors such as weather events and crop yields.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Fertilizer&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;China, Russia, United States, Canada, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Morocco&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;India, Brazil, Indonesia, United States, China&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Demand for fertilizer is seasonal, with higher demand in the spring and fall planting seasons.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Other important cargoes&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Containerized cargo:&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;containerized-cargo&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#containerized-cargo&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This includes a wide variety of goods, such as manufactured goods, electronics, and clothing. Containerized cargo is typically shipped on container ships, which have fixed routes and schedules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Breakbulk cargo:&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;breakbulk-cargo&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#breakbulk-cargo&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This includes goods that are too large or heavy to be shipped in containers, such as vehicles, machinery, and wind turbine blades. Breakbulk cargo is typically shipped on breakbulk ships, which have flexible routes and schedules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Ro/Ro cargo:&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;roro-cargo&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#roro-cargo&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This includes vehicles and other wheeled cargo that can be rolled on and off of ships. Ro/Ro cargo is typically shipped on ro/ro ships, which have special ramps and decks to accommodate this type of cargo.
Seasonal variations&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to the seasonal variations in demand for certain cargoes, there can also be seasonal variations in trade routes. For example, during the winter months, some shipping routes in the Arctic and Antarctic may be closed due to ice. Additionally, some ports may be closed during certain times of the year due to weather events or other factors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is important to note that the information above is general in nature. The specific places of origin, trade routes, and seasonal variations of important cargoes can vary depending on a number of factors, such as global economic conditions, geopolitical tensions, and weather events&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;h2&gt;What are Active Geological processes?&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;what-are-active-geological-processes&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#what-are-active-geological-processes&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Active geological processes are the forces that are constantly shaping and changing the Earth&amp;rsquo;s surface. These processes can be slow and gradual, like erosion, or they can be sudden and catastrophic, like volcanic eruptions and earthquakes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Here are some examples of active geological processes:&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;here-are-some-examples-of-active-geological-processes&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#here-are-some-examples-of-active-geological-processes&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Volcanoes&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;volcanoes&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#volcanoes&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Volcanoes are openings in the Earth&amp;rsquo;s crust that allow molten rock, ash, and gases to escape. When a volcano erupts, it can release a tremendous amount of energy, causing widespread destruction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Earthquakes&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;earthquakes&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#earthquakes&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earthquakes are caused by the sudden release of energy in the Earth&amp;rsquo;s crust. This energy can be released by the movement of tectonic plates, or by the eruption of a volcano. Earthquakes can cause widespread damage to buildings and infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Erosion&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;erosion&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#erosion&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Erosion is the process of wearing away and transporting rock and soil. It can be caused by wind, water, ice, and gravity. Erosion is a natural process that helps to shape the Earth&amp;rsquo;s surface, but it can also be a problem, especially in areas where it is accelerated by human activities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Glaciations&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;glaciations&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#glaciations&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Glaciations are periods of time when the Earth&amp;rsquo;s surface is covered in ice sheets and glaciers. Glaciations can last for millions of years, and they have a significant impact on the Earth&amp;rsquo;s climate and environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are just a few examples of the many active geological processes that are shaping the Earth today. These processes are essential for maintaining the planet&amp;rsquo;s habitability, but they can also pose a threat to human life and property. It is important to understand these processes and how to mitigate their risks.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>
        
        
        &lt;h2&gt;What is ABNJ?&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;what-is-abnj&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#what-is-abnj&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Areas beyond national jurisdiction (ABNJ) are those parts of the ocean that are not under the control of any one country. They cover about 64% of the ocean&amp;rsquo;s surface and 95% of its volume, making them the largest global commons on Earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ABNJ are home to a wide range of marine life and ecosystems, including many that are unique and found nowhere else on the planet. They also play a vital role in regulating the climate and providing essential resources to people around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, ABNJ are facing a number of challenges, including overfishing, pollution, and climate change. These challenges are interconnected and require a coordinated response from the global community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The conservation and management of resources in ABNJ is governed by a number of international agreements, including the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) and the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD). These agreements provide a framework for cooperation on a range of issues, including fisheries, shipping, and environmental protection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to international agreements, there are also a number of regional and subregional organizations that play a role in the conservation and management of ABNJ resources. These organizations work to coordinate management efforts and develop common standards and practices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Despite the existence of these agreements and organizations, there are still a number of challenges to the effective conservation and management of ABNJ resources. These challenges include:&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;despite-the-existence-of-these-agreements-and-organizations-there-are-still-a-number-of-challenges-to-the-effective-conservation-and-management-of-abnj-resources-these-challenges-include&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#despite-the-existence-of-these-agreements-and-organizations-there-are-still-a-number-of-challenges-to-the-effective-conservation-and-management-of-abnj-resources-these-challenges-include&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The fragmentation of the international ocean governance system&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The lack of effective enforcement mechanisms for international agreements&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The capacity constraints of developing countries&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The increasing pressure on marine resources from human activities&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite these challenges, there is a growing recognition of the importance of ABNJ conservation and management. The United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 14 calls for &amp;ldquo;conserving and sustainably using the oceans, seas and marine resources for sustainable development.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;There are a number of things that can be done to improve the conservation and management of ABNJ resources, including:&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;there-are-a-number-of-things-that-can-be-done-to-improve-the-conservation-and-management-of-abnj-resources-including&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#there-are-a-number-of-things-that-can-be-done-to-improve-the-conservation-and-management-of-abnj-resources-including&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strengthening international cooperation and coordination&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Improving the enforcement of international agreements&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Building capacity in developing countries&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Promoting sustainable ocean-based economies&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Raising public awareness of the importance of ABNJ conservation and sustainable use
Here are some specific examples of conservation and management measures that are being implemented in ABNJ:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Fishery management:&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;fishery-management&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#fishery-management&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regional fisheries management organizations (RFMOs) have been established to manage fisheries in ABNJ. RFMOs set catch limits, establish fishing seasons, and implement other measures to ensure the sustainable management of fish stocks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Marine protected areas:&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;marine-protected-areas&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#marine-protected-areas&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Marine protected areas (MPAs) can be used to protect vulnerable marine ecosystems and biodiversity in ABNJ. MPAs can be established through international agreements or by individual countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Pollution prevention and control:&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;pollution-prevention-and-control&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#pollution-prevention-and-control&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;A number of international agreements are in place to prevent and control pollution in ABNJ. These agreements address a range of pollutants, including oil, sewage, and hazardous substances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Climate change adaptation:&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;climate-change-adaptation&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#climate-change-adaptation&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The impacts of climate change are already being felt in ABNJ, and these impacts are expected to become more severe in the future. A number of international organizations and initiatives are working to help countries adapt to the impacts of climate change in ABNJ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The conservation and management of ABNJ resources is a complex and challenging task. However, it is essential that we find ways to manage these resources sustainably for the benefit of current and future generations.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;h2&gt;Hydrographic surveying&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;hydrographic-surveying&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#hydrographic-surveying&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;is a complex and demanding field, but it is also essential for safe navigation and maritime transportation. Hydrographic surveyors use a variety of techniques to collect data about the depth and position of underwater features. This data is then used to create nautical charts, which are essential for ships and boats to navigate safely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Here are some additional details about the basic techniques of hydrographic surveying:&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;here-are-some-additional-details-about-the-basic-techniques-of-hydrographic-surveying&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#here-are-some-additional-details-about-the-basic-techniques-of-hydrographic-surveying&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sounding:&lt;/strong&gt; Sounding is a relatively simple technique, but it can be very effective in shallow waters. To sound, a hydrographic surveyor will lower a weighted line, called a sounding lead, to the bottom of the water and then measure the depth. Sounding is typically done from a small boat, but it can also be done from shore or from a helicopter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Echo sounding:&lt;/strong&gt; Echo sounding is a more advanced technique that uses sound waves to measure the depth of water. An echo sounder emits a sound wave and then measures the time it takes for the wave to return to the surface. The depth of the water is then calculated based on the speed of sound in water. Echo sounding is more accurate than sounding and can be used to survey large areas of water quickly and efficiently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Side scan sonar:&lt;/strong&gt; Side scan sonar is a type of sonar that uses sound waves to create images of the seafloor. A side scan sonar system emits sound waves to the sides of a survey vessel and then measures the returning echoes. The echoes are then used to create a two-dimensional image of the seafloor. Side scan sonar is useful for detecting underwater features, such as shipwrecks and pipelines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Multibeam sonar:&lt;/strong&gt; Multibeam sonar is the most advanced type of sonar used in hydrographic surveying. It emits multiple sound beams in different directions to create a three-dimensional image of the seafloor. Multibeam sonar is the most accurate and efficient method of hydrographic surveying, but it is also the most expensive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to measuring depth, hydrographic surveys also collect information about the position of underwater features. This information is collected using a variety of positioning technologies, such as GPS, Differential Global Positioning System (DGPS), and Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the depth and positioning data has been collected, it is processed using specialized software to create a nautical chart. Nautical charts show the depth of water, the position of underwater features, and other important information for navigation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hydrographic surveys are conducted in a variety of environments, including oceans, lakes, rivers, and harbors. The specific techniques used will vary depending on the environment and the purpose of the survey. For example, a hydrographic survey of a shallow river might use sounding and GPS to measure the depth and position of the riverbed. A hydrographic survey of a deep ocean might use multibeam sonar and GNSS to create a detailed three-dimensional image of the seafloor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hydrographic surveying is an essential part of safe navigation and maritime transportation. Hydrographic surveyors collect the data that is used to create nautical charts, which are essential for ships and boats to navigate safely. Hydrographic surveys are also used for a variety of other purposes, such as coastal engineering, environmental monitoring, and marine research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Here are some examples of how hydrographic surveying is used in the real world:&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;here-are-some-examples-of-how-hydrographic-surveying-is-used-in-the-real-world&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#here-are-some-examples-of-how-hydrographic-surveying-is-used-in-the-real-world&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hydrographic surveys are used to create nautical charts for commercial and recreational shipping.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hydrographic surveys are used to map the seabed for coastal engineering projects, such as building new ports and harbors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hydrographic surveys are used to monitor environmental changes, such as coastal erosion and sea level rise.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hydrographic surveys are used to support marine research, such as studying the distribution of marine life and mapping the location of hydrothermal vents.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hydrographic surveying is a vital field that plays a critical role in the safety and efficiency of maritime transportation. Hydrographic surveyors use a variety of advanced techniques to collect data about the depth and position of underwater features. This data is then used to create nautical charts and support a variety of other important applications.&lt;/p&gt;

They provide information about the depth and shape of the seafloor, which can be used to map ocean currents, identify potential hazards, and understand the distribution of marine life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Methods of Bathymetric Studies&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;methods-of-bathymetric-studies&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#methods-of-bathymetric-studies&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two common methods of bathymetric data collection are precision depth recorders (PDRs) and side-scan sonar (SOPAR).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Precision depth recorders (PDRs) are acoustic devices that measure the depth of the seafloor by sending out a sound pulse and recording the time it takes for the echo to return. PDRs are typically mounted on the bottom of a ship or other vessel, and they can provide accurate depth measurements at high speeds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Side-scan sonar (SOPAR) is a type of sonar that uses sound waves to create images of the seafloor. SOPAR systems typically consist of two transducers that are mounted on the sides of a vessel. The transducers emit sound waves that bounce off the seafloor and are received by the other transducer. The difference in arrival time of the two echoes is used to create an image of the seafloor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How is the Bathymetric Data used?&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;how-is-the-bathymetric-data-used&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#how-is-the-bathymetric-data-used&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bathymetric data collected using PDRs and SOPAR can be used to create detailed maps of the seafloor. These maps can be used for a variety of purposes, including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mapping ocean currents: The depth and shape of the seafloor can influence the movement of ocean currents. Bathymetric data can be used to create models of ocean currents, which can be used to predict their behavior and impact on shipping, fisheries, and other human activities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Identifying potential hazards: Bathymetric data can be used to identify potential hazards such as underwater mountains, shipwrecks, and unexploded ordnance. This information can be used to avoid these hazards and reduce the risk of accidents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding the distribution of marine life: The depth and shape of the seafloor can also influence the distribution of marine life. Bathymetric data can be used to identify areas that are suitable for different types of marine life, which can be used to inform conservation and management efforts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to these specific applications, bathymetric data is also essential for basic research on the oceans. For example, bathymetric data can be used to study the formation and evolution of ocean basins, the movement of tectonic plates, and the impact of climate change on the oceans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, bathymetric studies play a vital role in our understanding of the oceans. PDRs and SOPAR are two common methods of bathymetric data collection that provide accurate and high-resolution data. This data can be used for a variety of purposes, including mapping ocean currents, identifying potential hazards, and understanding the distribution of marine life.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>
        
        
        &lt;p&gt;A bill of lading (BOL) is a legal document issued by a carrier (or their agent) to acknowledge receipt of cargo for shipment. It is a contract between the shipper, carrier, and consignee (receiver of the goods), and it serves several important functions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It acts as a receipt for the goods, confirming that the carrier has taken possession of them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It describes the goods being shipped, including their quantity, type, condition, and packaging.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It specifies the origin and destination of the shipment, as well as the agreed-upon transportation terms.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It serves as a contract of carriage, outlining the responsibilities of the carrier in transporting the goods safely and on time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It can be used as a document of title, meaning that the party holding it has the right to claim ownership of the goods.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bills of lading are used for all types of shipments, including domestic and international, and by all modes of transportation, including truck, rail, air, and ship. They are particularly important in international trade, where they play a vital role in facilitating the movement of goods and ensuring that all parties involved in the transaction are protected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two main types of bills of lading:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Straight bill of lading:&lt;/strong&gt; This type of bill of lading is non-negotiable, meaning that it cannot be transferred to another party. It is typically used when the goods are being shipped directly to the consignee.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Order bill of lading:&lt;/strong&gt; This type of bill of lading is negotiable, meaning that it can be transferred to another party by endorsement. This makes it a valuable financial instrument, as it can be used to secure financing for the shipment or to sell the goods to another party before they have arrived at their destination.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bills of lading are typically issued in three original copies, one for the shipper, one for the carrier, and one for the consignee. However, additional copies may be issued if needed, for example, for insurance purposes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some of the key benefits of using bills of lading:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;They provide a clear and concise record of the shipment.&lt;/strong&gt; This can be helpful in resolving disputes or tracking down lost or damaged goods.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;They help to protect the interests of all parties involved in the shipment.&lt;/strong&gt; The carrier is legally obligated to comply with the terms of the bill of lading, and the shipper and consignee have recourse if the carrier fails to do so.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;They can be used to facilitate financing and other financial transactions.&lt;/strong&gt; The negotiable nature of order bills of lading makes them a valuable financial instrument.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, bills of lading are an essential part of the shipping process. They provide a number of important benefits to all parties involved, and they help to ensure the safe and efficient movement of goods around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bill of Lading under Charter Party&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Three (3) Functions of Bill of Lading (B/L):&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;three-3-functions-of-bill-of-lading-bl&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#three-3-functions-of-bill-of-lading-bl&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;1- Evidence of a Contract&lt;br&gt;
2- Receipt &lt;br&gt;
3- Document of Title (DOT)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1- Evidence of a Contract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;1--evidence-of-a-contract&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#1--evidence-of-a-contract&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The contract to ship cargo is made well before the Bill of Lading (B/L) is signed. Therefore, when it is first produced the Bill of Lading (B/L) cannot be the contract itself. Nevertheless, a Bill of Lading (B/L) is evidence that there is a contract of shipment between the Shipper and the Carrier (Shipowner or Ship Operator). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Ardennes (1950) case, the Shipper was worried that the consignment of Spanish oranges should reach London before a scheduled increase in import duty and obtained an assurance that the vessel would proceed directly to London. On the way, the Shipowner decided to make Antwerp the vessel’s first port of discharge so that the oranges did not reach London until after the critical date. The Shipowner attempted to claim their right under the Liberties Clause in the printed wording of the Bill of Lading (B/L). However, Lord Goddard, in establishing the Shipper’s right to recover damages for breach of contract, highlighted that the contract, albeit a verbal contract, came into existence before the Bill of Lading (B/L) was signed. Furthermore, Lord Goddard, to underline the fact that a Bill of Lading (B/L) was not the contract, pointed out that a Bill of Lading (B/L) is only signed by one party. Therefore, a Bill of Lading (B/L) is evidence of a contract. Undoubtedly, a Bill of Lading (B/L) is considered the** best evidence of a contract**. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Endorsed Bills of Lading (B/L)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;endorsed-bills-of-lading-bl&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#endorsed-bills-of-lading-bl&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the Bill of Lading (B/L) is transferred to an &lt;strong&gt;Endorsee&lt;/strong&gt;, then the Bill of Lading (B/L) is the contract of carriage between the Endorsee and the Carrier. The terms of carriage will be those clauses incorporated in the Bill of Lading (B/L) itself. Therefore, an Endorsee of a Bill of Lading (B/L) is not affected by any contract between the Shipper and the Carrier. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the Carrier (Shipowner or Ship Operator) wants to incorporate into Bills of Lading (B/L) a clause that is completely out of keeping with the customary procedure, the Carrier (Shipowner or Ship Operator) ought not only to make it obvious in words but also to make it apparent by inserting it in such style and such part of the Bills of Lading (B/L) that an individual of ordinary capacity could not fail to notice unusual term. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bill of Lading (B/L) is not the contract but simply evidence of the contract. It does not follow that an individual, who accepts the Bill of Lading (B/L) that the Carrier delivers, is required and without regard to circumstances bound to abide by all Bill of Lading’s (B/L) terms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a Charterer employs the vessel to carry cargo for himself, then the Bill of Lading (B/L) is a Receipt and maybe a Document of Title (DOT) as well for the cargo. In this case, the Bill of Lading (B/L) is neither Evidence of nor the Contract of carriage. The Charterparty retains the contract for the carriage of the cargo between the Charterer and the Carrier (Shipowner or Ship Operator). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the Shipper is not the Consignee, the Bill of Lading (B/L) is the contract of carriage between the Carrier (Shipowner or Ship Operator) and the Consignee or Endorsee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bill of Lading (B/L) on Time Charter (T/C)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;bill-of-lading-bl-on-time-charter-tc&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#bill-of-lading-bl-on-time-charter-tc&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Issues may arise when the vessel is on Time Charter (T/C). Who is the Carrier in the contract of carriage under Time Charter (T/C)? The Voyage Charterer (Shipper) made a contract with the Time Charterer (Disponent Shipowner).  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a cargo claim arises the Voyage Charterer’s (Shipper’s) first recourse is inherently against the Time Charterer (Disponent Shipowner) although the damage to the cargo may have been the fault of the vessel. Where the issue can escalate is if the Time Charterer (Disponent Shipowner) is late in dealing with the claim and the Voyage Charterer (Shipper) decides to arrest the ship. Almost invariably, Time Charterparties have clauses that rule how these issues are resolved particularly where the Ship Master is required to sign the Bill of Lading (B/L) on behalf of the Time Charterer (Disponent Shipowner).   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2- Receipt&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;2--receipt&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#2--receipt&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bill of Lading (B/L) stipulates the &lt;strong&gt;quantity&lt;/strong&gt; and the &lt;strong&gt;details&lt;/strong&gt; of cargoes. In non-containerized cargoes, Bills of Lading (B/L) stipulate the number of tonnes and/or the volume of the cargoes in cubic meters. Furthermore, Bill of Lading (B/L) stipulates any identifying marks or numbers of cargoes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bill of Lading (B/L) stipulates the &lt;strong&gt;condition&lt;/strong&gt; of the cargoes when loaded on board. In most Bill of Lading (B/L), the expression “apparent good order and condition” is incorporated. If the “apparent good order and condition” expression is unqualified the Bill of Lading (B/L) is referred to as being a** Clean Bill of Lading (B/L)**. If the cargoes are not in apparent good order and condition then the Bill of Lading (B/L) is referred to as being a &lt;strong&gt;Claused Bill of Lading (B/L)&lt;/strong&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In container shipping, if the cargo is delivered as an FCL (Full Container Load), the Carrier has no way of knowing either the quantity or condition of the cargo themselves and beyond checking that the weight of the container does not exceed its permitted load, the Bill of Lading (B/L) will only show the Container Number. Furthermore, if the Shipper requires a reference to the contents of the container, the Bill of Lading (B/L) will include the expression “said to contain”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In dry bulk shipping, there is no accurate method for the Ship Master to check the weight of the cargo. A Draft Survey is a reasonable inspection but by no means precise. Consequently, in dry bulk shipping, it is customary for the Bill of Lading (B/L) under a Charterparty to express the weight as &lt;strong&gt;Works Weight&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;Docks Weight&lt;/strong&gt;, followed by the expression “weight shipped unknown”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3- Document of Title (DOT)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;3--document-of-title-dot&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#3--document-of-title-dot&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bill of Lading (B/L) function as a Document of Title is threefold:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3.1- Negotiable Document&lt;br&gt;
3.2- Claim Cargoes&lt;br&gt;
3.3- Security for Payment&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3.1- Negotiable Document&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;31--negotiable-document&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#31--negotiable-document&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bill of Lading (B/L) is a Negotiable Document. In other words, Bill of Lading (B/L) is a &lt;strong&gt;Transferable Documents&lt;/strong&gt;. What the transfer of Negotiable Bill of Lading (B/L) does pass is &lt;strong&gt;Constructive Possession&lt;/strong&gt; of the cargoes. In other words, the right to demand of the Carrier the delivery of the cargoes on presentation of the Bills of Lading (B/L). There is** no limit** to the number of times Bill of Lading (B/L) can be sold-on when the cargoes are still in transit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3.2- Claim Cargoes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;32--claim-cargoes&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#32--claim-cargoes&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bill of Lading (B/L) enable the &lt;strong&gt;Bill of Lading (B/L) Holder&lt;/strong&gt; to claim cargoes. The Carrier must only deliver the cargo to the Bill of Lading (B/L) Holder. Therefore, Bill of Lading (B/L) are important documents. Bill of Lading (B/L) is the key to the cargo. The Carrier will not be justified in delivering the cargo to anyone other than the Bill of Lading (B/L) Holder or Bill of Lading (B/L) Holder’s Agent unless there is a particular custom of the port or an Express Agreement to the contrary in the Charterparty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3.3- Security for Payment&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;33--security-for-payment&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#33--security-for-payment&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bill of Lading’s (B/L) third function as a Document of Title (DOT) is a Security for Payment. At the time of cargo shipment, in a case where freight is to be paid on completion of loading, the Carrier or the Carrier’s Agent will not hand over Bill of Lading (B/L) expressing Freight Prepaid without first receiving payment. Furthermore, the function of security for payment materializes when payment for the cargo is via a documentary Letter of Credit (L/C).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;International Trade and Bill of Lading (B/L)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;international-trade-and-bill-of-lading-bl&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#international-trade-and-bill-of-lading-bl&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In cases where the Shipper has sold the cargoes under a Letter of Credit (L/C) opened through a bank or in cases where the Shipper wants to receive payment before the Consignee receives the cargoes, the Shipper will pass the Original Bill of Lading (B/L) to the bank who, in due course, will arrange a presentation to the Consignee against payment of the cargoes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, most international trade payments are completed via Letter of Credit (L/C). Bills of Lading (B/L) are deemed as a Document of Title to the cargoes. Banks do not want to take actual possession of the cargo. However, Bills of Lading (B/L) allow the banks to facilitate payment for the cargo from the buyer to the seller. If there is any default in payment, the bank could indeed become the actual possessor of the cargo but this is only a last resort position. Therefore, the strictest accuracy of the details in the description of the cargo should appear on the Bills of Lading (B/L). Credit is extended based on a bank’s faith in the facts of the expressed description of the cargo in the Bills of Lading (B/L) and any other documentation the Letter of Credit (L/C) may require:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1- Cargo Invoice &lt;br&gt;
2- Cargo Marine Insurance Policy &lt;br&gt;
3- Consular Documents &lt;br&gt;
4- Cargo Export License&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Claused Bill of Lading (B/L) and Letters of Indemnity (LOI)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;claused-bill-of-lading-bl-and-letters-of-indemnity-loi&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#claused-bill-of-lading-bl-and-letters-of-indemnity-loi&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Banks do not accept Bill of Lading (B/L) that contain any wording to indicate that the cargo, when received on board the ship, was in other than &lt;strong&gt;Apparent Good Order and Condition&lt;/strong&gt;. If any remark appears, the Bill of Lading (B/L) is known as Claused (Unclean) Bill of Lading (B/L). Similarly, banks do not accept Bill of Lading (B/L) that is not &lt;strong&gt;Shipped on Board Bill of Lading (B/L)&lt;/strong&gt;. In other words, banks do not accept &lt;strong&gt;Received for Shipment Bill of Lading (B/L)&lt;/strong&gt; which meanscargo is not loaded on board the ship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Usually, the Shipper seeks to present a Letter of Indemnity (LOI) to the Carrier (Shipowner or Ship Operator) which will hold the Carrier (Shipowner or Ship Operator) harmless against the issuance of Clean Bill of Lading (B/L) when in reality the cargo to be shipped is damaged or defective when loaded on the ship. Issuing Clean Bill of Lading (B/L) against a damaged or defective cargo is &lt;strong&gt;Fraud&lt;/strong&gt; and such a Letter of Indemnity (LOI) is not worth the paper it is written on. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Brown Jenkinson &amp;amp; Co V Percy Dalton (1957) case, an agreement between the Shipper and the Carrier’s (Shipowner or Ship Operator) Agent, whereby the Carrier’s (Shipowner or Ship Operator) Agent agreed to accept from the Shipper the issue of a Letter of Indemnity (LOI) in exchange for the issue of &lt;strong&gt;Clean Bill of Lading (B/L)&lt;/strong&gt; in respect of damaged or defective cargo, was considered by the Court of Appeal to be illegal and unenforceable in the eyes of the law. Undoubtedly, all the elements of the Tort of Deceit were present when the Carrier’s (Shipowner or Ship Operator) Agent made a False Representation which they intended should be relied upon by the receivers of the Bill of Lading (B/L) and the bank.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any Bill of Lading (B/L) intended for negotiation through a Letter of Credit (L/C) must be issued &lt;strong&gt;To Order&lt;/strong&gt; without any reference to a Consignee. However, Bills of Lading (B/L) may incorporate a space to name a &lt;strong&gt;Notify Party&lt;/strong&gt;. Then, the Bill of Lading (B/L) has to be endorsed by the Shipper which then opens the Bill of Lading (B/L). In other words, anyone holding such Bill of Lading (B/L) can claim title to the cargo even if that person picked up the Bills of Lading (B/L) in the street. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bill of Lading (B/L) under Charter Party&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;bill-of-lading-bl-under-charter-party&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#bill-of-lading-bl-under-charter-party&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If a Bill of Lading (B/L) is issued under a Charter Party (Contract of Carriage), the Bill of Lading (B/L) ceases to be considered evidence of this contract. In any contract of carriage which is incorporated in a Charterparty, it is the Charterparty itself that is the contract. Accordingly, the Bill of Lading (B/L) regarding this contract serves simply as a Document of Title (DOT) and as a Receipt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the Bill of Lading (B/L) is endorsed to a Third Party (Endorsee), then there is at this point a new and second contract. In this case, the Bill of Lading (B/L) is now deemed as evidence of this second contract.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Incorporation of Charterparty Clauses into Bill of Lading (B/L)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;incorporation-of-charterparty-clauses-into-bill-of-lading-bl&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#incorporation-of-charterparty-clauses-into-bill-of-lading-bl&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bills of Lading (B/L) are generally expressed to incorporate the terms and conditions of the Charterparty. How and which provisions are incorporated into the Bills of Lading (B/L) depends primarily on the wording used in the incorporating clause. Only the clauses that are **Expressly Incorporated **into the Bills of Lading (B/L) will be considered as being so incorporated. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where the cargo has been loaded on a chartered vessel, the Bills of Lading (B/L) usually incorporate a clause expressing &lt;strong&gt;all other conditions and exceptions as per Charterparty&lt;/strong&gt;. Nevertheless, the incorporating clause does not incorporate provisions that are inconsistent with the Bills of Lading (B/L) or which do not affect the consignee’s right to take delivery. Conclusive Evidence Clause is not considered by the Court to be an exception nor is it considered to be a condition to be performed by a consignee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a clause in the Bills of Lading (B/L) to incorporate some or all of the terms of the Charterparty, such a clause must be **unambiguous **and &lt;strong&gt;express&lt;/strong&gt;. Whether the terms of a Charterparty have been incorporated into the Bills of Lading (B/L) is in each case a matter of construction. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, the former interpretation of such clauses as “all terms, conditions, clauses, and exceptions contained in the Charterparty will apply to the Bills of Lading (B/L)” does not be deemed adequate to incorporate any term of the Charterparty which is inconsistent with any Express Term in the Bills of Lading (B/L). Consequently, care must be taken with such incorporation clauses to avoid the possibility of conflicts materializing at a later time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Incorporation issues become critical when the Bills of Lading (B/L) are transferred from the Charterer to a Third Party (Endorsee) because the Endorsee is not a party to the Charterparty. Therefore, this is where a new contractual case materializes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The wording of the Bills of Lading (B/L) is the starting pinpoint. A Charterparty clause that is not directly appropriate to the load, carriage, or delivery of the cargoes should not be incorporated into the Bills of Lading (B/L) unless by Express Terms. Even a term that is proper may not be incorporated into the Bills of Lading (B/L) if that term is the proper construction of the relevant contract.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Incorporation Clause:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;incorporation-clause&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#incorporation-clause&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;a- The incorporating clause must be construed to see whether incorporating clause is broad enough to bring about the incorporation of the relevant term. General phrases of incorporation will be effective to incorporate only those terms of the charter which relate to the shipment carriage or discharge of the cargo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;b- The term to be incorporated must make sense in the context of the Bills of Lading (B/L); if the incorporated term does not, it must be rejected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;c- The term to be incorporated must be consistent with the Express Terms of the Bills of Lading (B/L); If the incorporated term is not, it will be rejected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Arbitration Clause&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;arbitration-clause&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#arbitration-clause&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Arbitration Clause should be directly stipulated in the Bills of Lading (B/L). The parties should not rely upon general terms to accomplish incorporation. Charterparty Arbitration Clause is incorporated into Bills of Lading (B/L) if either there are specific expressions of incorporation in the Bills of Lading (B/L), the Arbitration Clause is so framed as to make sense in the context of the Bills of Lading (B/L) and the clause does not contradict with the Express Terms of the Bills of Lading (B/L); or there are general expressions of incorporation in the Bills of Lading (B/L) and the Arbitration Clause or some other provision in the Charterparty makes it clear that the clause is to govern disagreements under the Bills of Lading (B/L) as well as under the charter. In all other cases, the Charterparty arbitration clause is not incorporated into the Bills of Lading (B/L). A clause aiming to incorporate “all conditions as per charter party” would not express an Arbitration Clause, and a Charterparty Arbitration Clause referring Charterparty disagreements to arbitration could not be manipulated in such a way as to include the Bills of Lading (B/L) disagreements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who is the Carrier in the Bills of Lading (B/L)?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;who-is-the-carrier-in-the-bills-of-lading-bl&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#who-is-the-carrier-in-the-bills-of-lading-bl&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the Bill of Lading (B/L) Holder is not the Charterer the question emerges as to whether it is the Shipowner or the Charterer that the Bill of Lading (B/L) Holder sues for damage to the cargo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In most cases, the Bills of Lading (B/L) are issued by the Ship Master who is typically the servant and agent of the Shipowner. If cargo is loaded on board a ship under a Charterparty (Contract of Carriage), the usual assumption is that the Shipper has contracted with the Shipowner. In the absence of any exceptional cases, the Shipper may assume that the Ship Master is the agent of the Shipowner. The Ship Master binds the Shipowner even if a form is utilized which is not authorized by the Charterparty (Contract of Carriage). If the Shipper does know the terms of the Charterparty (Contract of Carriage), the Shipper is or should be aware that to sign Bills of Lading (B/L) other than in the particular form is beyond the Ship Master’s authority, the Shipowner will not be liable to the Shipper but the Charterer will be liable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, primarily in the liner trade, Charterers issue their Bills of Lading (B/L), putting themselves forward as the contractual Carrier. In such cases, the Bills of Lading (B/L) Holder will have a choice as to whom to sue for damages to the cargo. In practice, the Bills of Lading (B/L) Holder will protect his interest against both Shipowners and the Charterers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bills of Lading’s (B/L) Important Clauses&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;bills-of-ladings-bl-important-clauses&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#bills-of-ladings-bl-important-clauses&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ship Operators have been pursuing to incorporate clauses into the Bills of Lading (B/L) that will give them as many rights and immunities as possible. In some cases, such clauses comprise the terms of carriage under which the cargo is carried on the Bills of Lading (B/L). Bills of Lading’s (B/L) Important Clauses are:-&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;**1- Lien Clause: **Lien Clause specifies that the Shipowner is entitled to a lien on the cargo in particular cases related to non-payment of the freight. This is a Contractual Lien. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2- Clause Paramount:&lt;/strong&gt; By Clause Paramount the Hague-Visby Rules may be incorporated within the terms of the Bills of Lading (B/L). Hague-Visby Rules are automatically incorporated into any Bills of Lading (B/L) that serve to evidence the contract of carriage and which is issued in respect of a port of shipment from the United Kingdom. Clause Paramount is crucial because unless expressly incorporated, the Hague-Visby Rules **do not **apply to Charterparties. Therefore, if a Bill of Lading (B/L) is issued under a Charterparty, the Charterparty will not be covered by the Hague-Visby Rules unless the Hague-Visby Rules are expressly incorporated into the Bill of Lading (B/L).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3- Voyage Clause:&lt;/strong&gt; Voyage Clause allows the ship to steam with or without pilots or tugs, to tow or to be towed, and to call at any port in any order both on and off the announced route, and to carry particular cargoes on deck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hague-Visby Rules (Article 1c) exclude live animals and goods carried on deck from the definition of goods to which the Hague-Visby Rules apply. Nevertheless, in consideration of cargo carried on deck, the exclusion is only effective where the contract of carriage expressly remarks that the goods are carried on deck. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a Voyage Clause that expressed that cargo may be carried on deck does not have the effect of excluding the Hague-Visby Rules. The Hague-Visby Rules may only be excluded by an Express Notification in the Bills of Lading (B/L) that the precise cargo is being carried on deck. Such a notification would serve as a forewarning to the Consignees (Endorsees) of the Bills of Lading (B/L) that the cargo was being shipped as Deck Cargo. Therefore, the Consignees (Endorsees) would have a total understanding of the facts when accepting the documents and would know that the carriage of the Deck Cargo was not subject to the obligations imposed on the Carrier by the Hague-Visby Rules. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the absence of Deck Cargo Express Notification in the Bills of Lading (B/L), the Consignees (Endorsees) of the Bills of Lading (B/L) would be entitled to presume that Hague-Visby Rules’ obligations were so imposed. A mere general liberty to carry cargo on deck is not a statement in the contract of carriage that the goods are being carried on deck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4- Himalaya Clause:&lt;/strong&gt; Himalaya Clause is incorporated into the Charter Parties (C/P) or Bills of Lading (B/L) to provide to servants, agents, subcontractors, etc. of the Carrier (Shipowner or Ship Operator) the advantages of all the exclusions and limitations enjoyed by the actual Carrier (Shipowner or Ship Operator) under the Bills of Lading (B/L) which protects them against Consignees (Endorsees) for claims in Contract or Tort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Adler Vs Dickson (The Himalaya) 1955 Case, Ship Master, and Bosun were held responsible for a passenger who fell due to incorrect rigging of the gang-plank. The injured passenger realized that she could not claim damages from the shipping line under the phrasing of the passenger ticket. The injured passenger successfully sued the Ship Master and the errant Bosun in Tort. Consequently, Shipowners incorporated a clause, expressed in the form of the Himalaya Clause, in all passenger tickets and Bills of Lading (B/L).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Incorporating a Himalaya Clause into a Bill of Lading (B/L) drafted under the Hague Visby Rules is redundant because a form of Himalaya Clause is contained in Article IV bis of the Hague Visby Rules&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the Carrier (Shipowner or Ship Operator) contracts as an agent for a Third Party, for instance, a Dockworker Company, the Third Party can enforce the terms of the Bill of Lading (B/L) against the Shipper:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a- If the Bill of Lading (B/L) explicitly states that the Dockworker Company is entitled to be protected by the provisions in the Bill of Lading (B/L) which limit liability&lt;br&gt;
b- If the Bill of Lading (B/L) explicitly states that the Carrier, in addition to contracting for these provisions on his behalf is also contracting as an agent for the Third Party (Dockworker Company) that those provisions should apply to the Third Party&lt;br&gt;
c- The Carrier has authority from the Third Party (Dockworker Company) to do that &lt;br&gt;
d- Any problems about consideration moving from the Third Party (Dockworker Company) would be overcome&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5- General Average (GA) Clause:&lt;/strong&gt; The Bill of Lading (B/L) expresses the fact that if General Average (GA) is to arise then the &lt;strong&gt;York-Antwerp Rules&lt;/strong&gt; should apply&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6- Transhipment Clause:&lt;/strong&gt; Transhipment Clause expresses the circumstances under which cargo must be transshipped. Transhipment Clause authorizes the Shipowner to undertake a voyage in this way and is a means of enabling the Shipowner to be exonerated from responsibility once the cargo has unloaded from the ship, even though the Shipowner has, under the terms of the Bill of Lading (B/L), undertaken to carry the cargo to the final destination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;**7- Salvage Clause: **Salvage Clause apply in circumstances where it may be necessary to salve a ship and/or a rowboat. Salvage Clause establishes that a **Salvage Award **should also be paid in cases where there is a sister ship salvage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8- Freight Clause:&lt;/strong&gt; The Freight Clause deals with the settlement of freight under the Bill of Lading (B/L).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;**What are the Types of Bills of Lading (B/L)? **&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;what-are-the-types-of-bills-of-lading-bl&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#what-are-the-types-of-bills-of-lading-bl&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1- Conventional Bills of Lading (B/L)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;1--conventionalbills-of-lading-bl&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#1--conventionalbills-of-lading-bl&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conventional Bills of Lading (B/L) are almost invariably Shipped of Lading (B/L). Conventional Bills of Lading (B/L) are issued for any cargo except that which is carried in a container. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conventional Bills of Lading (B/L) have been the basic document for general cargo for many years. Conventional Bills of Lading (B/L) are the backbone of any documentary Letter of Credit (L/C) transactions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ship’s Rail:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;ships-rail&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#ships-rail&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The basic legal point is that liability under such Conventional Bills of Lading (B/L) does not commence until the cargo passes the ship’s rail at the loading port and ceases immediately after the cargo passes the vessel’s rail at discharging port. This may cause some conflicts. For instance, cargo slipping out of the sling over the quayside. Cargo has not passed the ship’s rail therefore the Bills of Lading (B/L) requirements will not have come into play.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether or not the Dock Workers are sub-contractors to the Carrier (Shipowner or Ship Operator) may be a moot point. Commonly, the Dock Workers are employees of the terminal with whom the Shipper would have a particular agreement. On the other hand, the Stevedores (workers on the ship itself) are almost always servants of the Carrier (Shipowner or Ship Operator).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In another case, the Consignee was delayed in collecting the cargo which was left on the quayside after the vessel sailed. On collecting the cargo, the cargo was encountered to have suffered rain damage while lying on the quayside. No claim is practicable under the Bills of Lading (B/L) which ceased at the Ship’s Rail. There may conceivably be a claim against the Terminal Operator depending upon the contractual position. Possibly even a claim in Tort against the Ship Agent who had a duty of care towards the Cargo Owner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unless the Charterparty (Contract for Carriage) delivers for the Shipper to be responsible for the loading and discharging operations, the Carrier (Shipowner or Ship Operator) may be held liable for any cargo damage occurring before loading and/or the subsequent discharge while the cargo is in the Carrier’s possession. Under these circumstances, the Charterparty (Contract for Carriage) terms are presumably to contractually extend the Hague-Visby Rules to comprise these periods thereby giving the Carrier (Shipowner or Ship Operator) the benefit of the defenses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2- Received for Shipment Bills of Lading (B/L)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;2--received-for-shipment-bills-of-lading-bl&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#2--received-for-shipment-bills-of-lading-bl&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In some rare cases, Received for Shipment Bills of Lading (B/L) are issued. For instance, if there is congestion at the port, whereby cargo may be waiting for shipment on board a ship, the Carrier (Shipowner or Ship Operator) may issue Received for Shipment Bills of Lading (B/L) which means that the cargo has been handed over to the Carrier (Shipowner or Ship Operator) and is in the Carrier’s custody, but the cargo has not been loaded on board the ship. The cargo may be stowed in a storage or transit shed or even on the quayside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3- Shipped Bills of Lading (B/L)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;3--shipped-bills-of-lading-bl&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#3--shipped-bills-of-lading-bl&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the cargo is actually loaded on board the ship, Received for Shipment Bills of Lading (B/L) is changed with the &lt;strong&gt;Shipped Bills of Lading (B/L)&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UnderShipped Bills of Lading (B/L), the cargo is safely on board the ship in the custody of the Carrier (Shipowner or Ship Operator), under the Received for Shipment Bills of Lading (B/L) this is not so. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UnderReceived for Shipment Bills of Lading (B/L), the cargo is wide open to the risks of fire, pilferage, loss, or damage caused by the weather. Received for Shipment Bills of Lading (B/L) give no certainty to the safety of the cargo so far as the various parties to the contract of carriage may be concerned. In these cases, Received for Shipment Bills of Lading (B/L) do not evidence of actual shipment. It may be that the cargo is not actually loaded on board the named ship. There is suspicion as to the actual fulfillment of the Shippers’ legal obligations under the contract. Therefore, the Received for Shipment Bills of Lading (B/L) is not acceptable to banks in the transaction of global trade. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4- Through Bills of Lading (B/L)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;4--through-bills-of-lading-bl&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#4--through-bills-of-lading-bl&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Through Bills of Lading (B/L) are identical in formation and function to the Conventional Bills of Lading (B/L), except on the face of Through Bills of Lading (B/L), there are boxes for the name of a pre-carrier to be inserted together with the place of acceptance by the pre-carrier. Thereafter the standard port of loading and port of discharge is followed by the name of the on-carrier with space for showing the place of delivery by the on-carrier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through Bills of Lading (B/L) are suitable where the ocean carrier is remote from the place of origin and/or place of destination so that the cargo has to be fed to/from the loading/discharging port of the ocean carrier, generally by short-sea ships.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through Bills of Lading (B/L) should not be confused with** Combined Transport Bills of Lading (CT-B/L)**. The difference between Through Bills of Lading (B/L) and Combined Transport Bills of Lading (CT-B/L) is that, underThrough Bills of Lading (B/L), the &lt;strong&gt;Ocean Carrier acts as an Agent&lt;/strong&gt; for the Pre-Carrier or On-Carrier. UnderThrough Bills of Lading (B/L), &lt;strong&gt;Ocean Carrier&lt;/strong&gt; undertakes to make the arrangements and charges a single through shipping rate but &lt;strong&gt;Ocean Carrier’s liability is only for the ocean voyage&lt;/strong&gt;, claims arising through issues during pre-carriage or on-carriage have to be made to those parties &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5- Combined Transport Bills of Lading (CT-B/L)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;5--combined-transport-bills-of-ladingct-bl&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#5--combined-transport-bills-of-ladingct-bl&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Combined Transport Bills of Lading (CT-B/L) were practically designed to serve the container business. The face of the Combined Transport Bills of Lading (CT-B/L) is similar to the Through Bills of Lading (B/L) in having extra boxes for the place of receipt and place of delivery.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The essential difference between a Combined Transport Bills of Lading (CT-B/L) and a Through Bills of Lading (B/L) is that under the Combined Transport Bills of Lading (CT-B/L), &lt;strong&gt;the Carrier accepts liability for the Entire Carriage&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the container business, there may be pre-carriage or on-carriage by rail, barge, or truck and with the ocean carriers becoming ever larger, feeder container ships may be used to or from the hub ports. Combined Transport Bills of Lading (CT-B/L) have to deal with all these arrangements and the clauses on the back of the Combined Transport Bills of Lading (CT-B/L) are developed to facilitate these multiple transportations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One issue that has to be overcome is the variation in international agreements covering ocean carriage, rail carriage, and road haulage. Especially, the variations in international agreements affect &lt;strong&gt;Time-Bars&lt;/strong&gt; and limitations of &lt;strong&gt;Liability&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, Combined Transport Bills of Lading (CT-B/L) stipulates that if loss or damage is occurring whilst being transported by road the applicable convention will be the international convention &lt;strong&gt;CMR (Convention Relative au Contrat de Tranportation des Marchandises par vois de Routs).&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Combined Transport Bills of Lading (CT-B/L) stipulates that if loss or damage is occurring when crossing an international border by rail the applicable convention will be &lt;strong&gt;CIM (Convention Internationale concernant le transport de Marchandises par Chemin de Fer)&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In rare cases, Combined Transport Bills of Lading (CT-B/L) cover ocean carriage and air freight, the air transportation is governed by the** Warsaw Convention**.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These international conventions’ time-bar periods are much shorter than Hague-Visby Rules. These international conventions’ limitations of liability are different in quantum and procedures of calculation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, these international conventions only apply when the transportation is across an** international border** which means that if no border crossing is concerned then the rules applicable to the country concerned will apply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is important to keep in mind that if it is proved that damage was caused during the sea voyage, then the &lt;strong&gt;Hague-Visby Rules&lt;/strong&gt; apply. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;**Which c****onvention (regulation) applies if it cannot be established at which stage of the transportation the loss or damage took place?  **&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;which-convention-regulation-applies-if-it-cannot-be-established-at-which-stage-of-the-transportation-the-loss-or-damage-took-place&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#which-convention-regulation-applies-if-it-cannot-be-established-at-which-stage-of-the-transportation-the-loss-or-damage-took-place&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;Principally, most carriers stipulate that the claim must be brought under the &lt;strong&gt;Hague-Visby Rules&lt;/strong&gt;; other carriers stipulate an overriding procedure. Both the United Nations (UN) and the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) have drafted proposed international conventions on intermodalism to clarify this problem. However, to date, neither of these has gained adequate support to convince governments to ratify them.    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It can easily be noticed why the Carrier’s liability must commence sooner if the cargo passes into the Carrier’s hands somewhere inland but less easy to see why Combined Transport Bills of Lading (CT-B/L) is required when a Full Container Load (FCL) is booked from Port-to-Port (Quay-to-Quay). The point is that the Carrier requires full control of all the containers intended to be loaded to rearrange the containers near the dock before the container ship arrives so that the correct sequence of loading can be arranged. This procedure is called Container Ship Planning. Container Ship Planning depends not only on the port of discharge but also on the weight of the container as the heavier containers have to be stowed lower down in the container ship. Therefore,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quay-to-Quay Combined Transport Bills of Lading (CT-B/L) would show the place of receipt CY (Container Yard).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Shipper’s cargo pass to the Carrier’s custody before crossing the container ship’s rail is the rationale for the essential difference between Combined Transport Bills of Lading (CT-B/L) and other Bills of Lading (B/L).  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Combined Transport Bills of Lading (CT-B/L) are Received for Shipment Bills of Lading (B/L). Theoretically, the Shipper can request Received for Shipment Bills of Lading (B/L) as soon as the cargo passes into the Carrier’s control, which could even be at the manufacturer’s doors. Such requests are infrequently if ever, made in practice because the Shipper would then have to return the Received for Shipment Bills of Lading (B/L) to the Carrier to have it endorsed with the details of being shipped on board. Nevertheless, all Combined Transport Bills of Lading (CT-B/L) have to be endorsed on the face with confirmation of being shipped with the date of shipment and a signature by the Carrier or the Carrier’s Agent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Combined Transport Bills of Lading (CT-B/L) differ from most other Bills of Lading (B/L) because even if Combined Transport Bills of Lading (CT-B/L) are for a simple Door-to-Door movement, the Bills of Lading (B/L) are not spent when the cargo crosses the container ship’s rail at discharging port but remains in force until the cargo pass into the consignee’s control in the discharging port CY (Container Yard). Agreements beyond Door-to-Door stay in force until the cargo reach wherever it had been agreed that the agreement extends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Difficulties have materialized in this respect because some container operators offer consignees the option of declaring a change of place of inland destination. The Shipper may have initially consigned the container as a Port-to-Port shipment, therefore the destination would appear in the name of a discharging port CY (Container Yard). Under the option granted the Consignee could declare the decision within the stipulated time and could agree to pay the amount offered for the road haulage by the container operators, after which the container could be delivered to the Consignee’s location.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6- Sea Waybills&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;6--sea-waybills&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#6--sea-waybills&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sea Waybills are identical in many respects to Bills of Lading (B/L). However, there is one essential difference between Sea Waybills and Bills of Lading (B/L), &lt;strong&gt;Sea Waybills are Non-Negotiable&lt;/strong&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In many cases, the payment arrangements between buyer and seller do not require a Letter of Credit (L/C). Furthermore, the Consignee has no intention to sell the cargo during the voyage. All that is then needed is for the Sea Waybills to require the Carrier to deliver the goods to a Named Consignee after checking the Consignee’s Identity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sea Waybills do not have a Document of Title (DOT) function&lt;/strong&gt;. Not being a Document of Title there is no requirement to present Sea Waybills to the Carrier to claim the cargo. Therefore, all the difficulties of cargo arriving before the Bills of Lading (B/L) disappear. This qualifies electronic communication and Cargo Manifest can be transmitted by electronic means and preparations to arrange delivery when the time comes can be made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Originally, Sea Waybills did not give Consignees the same facility to sue the Carrier as was available with the Bills of Lading (B/L). However, this problem was corrected when the** Carriage of Goods by Sea Act 1992 ** replaced the &lt;strong&gt;Bill of Lading Act 1855&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7- House Bills of Lading (B/L)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;7--house-bills-of-lading-bl&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#7--house-bills-of-lading-bl&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Non-Vessel Operating Carriers (NVOCs) contract as the Carrier with the Shippers of individual cargoes and Non-Vessel Operating Carriers (NVOCs) contract with the Ocean Carrier as an FCL (Full Container Load) Shipper. Therefore, the Container Line issues a Bill of Lading (B/L) for the container with no precise reference to the container’s contents. The Container Line delivers the container to the Non-Vessel Operating Carrier’s (NVOC) Discharging Port Operating Partner. The Non-Vessel Operating Carrier (NVOC) issues the company’s Bill of Lading (B/L) to each consignor. Non-Vessel Operating Carrier’s (NVOC) Discharging Port Operating Partner is responsible for delivering the cargo to the respective consignees against the presentation of the appropriate Bill of Lading (B/L).  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shippers dealing directly with a Container Line should be satisfied as to the Container Line’s integrity, so must Shippers dealing with Non-Vessel Operating Carriers (NVOCs) make their assessments; especially regarding clauses dealing with Limitations of Liability. Fortunately, FIATA (International Federation of Freight Forwarders Associations) has done much to encourage the use of a standard form of House Bills of Lading (B/L).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;**Mate’s Receipt (MR) **&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;mates-receipt-mr&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#mates-receipt-mr&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bills of Lading (B/L) are concluded and signed sometime after the cargo has been loaded therefore the details at the moment of loading of **bulk (non-containerized) **cargo are documented in the form of a Mate’s Receipt (MR). Traditionally, Mate’s Receipt (MR) is prepared and issued by the &lt;strong&gt;Chief Officer (Chief Mate)&lt;/strong&gt; of a ship whose job is to check the correct receipt of the cargo loaded on board and to supervise the cargo stowage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mate’s Receipt (MR) indicates any discrepancies in the quantity or pre-shipment condition of the cargo. From the moment of issue of the Mate’s Receipt (MR), the Shipowner is in full possession of the cargo, and from that moment the Shipowner is responsible for the safety of that cargo per the pre-shipment condition of cargo as stipulated in the Mate’s Receipt (MR). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the cargo is loaded on board the Shipper can demand the issue of the Bills of Lading (B/L) and all essential data will be transferred from the Mate’s Receipt (MR) to the Bills of Lading (B/L) itself. Today, the Mate’s Receipt (MR) is a copy of the &lt;strong&gt;Shipping Note (Dock Receipt)&lt;/strong&gt; and the checking is carried out by Tally Clerks or Cargo Inspectors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neither the &lt;strong&gt;Mate’s Receipt (MR)&lt;/strong&gt; nor indeed the &lt;strong&gt;Shipping Note (Dock Receipt)&lt;/strong&gt; is in any way referred to as a Document of Title (DOT) and the information that is made therein is not conclusive evidence against the Ship Master or the Shipowner. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Missing Bill of Lading (B/L)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;missing-bill-of-lading-bl&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#missing-bill-of-lading-bl&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is typical for cargo to be available for collection by the Consignee but the Consignee is unable to do so because the Consignee has no Original Bill of Lading (B/L) to claim the consignment. The Carrier (Shipowner or Ship Operator) must deliver the cargo only to one who presents a valid Original Bill of Lading (B/L).  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Consignee may present a **Letter of Indemnity (LOI)**&lt;strong&gt;for Missing Bills of Lading (B/L).&lt;/strong&gt; Unlike letters of indemnity for Clean Bills of Lading (B/L), a Letter of Indemnity (LOI) for Missing Bills of Lading (B/L) is &lt;strong&gt;not fraudulent&lt;/strong&gt; but it does have its drawbacks.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, a Letter of Indemnity (LOI) for Missing Bills of Lading (B/L) has to be comprehensively dependable and this is performed by the letter being countersigned by a First-Class Bank.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secondly, a Letter of Indemnity (LOI) for Missing Bills of Lading (B/L) must be unqualified. Most banks are hesitant to issue unqualified letters because banks have no method of assessing the risk they are taking.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thirdly, it is pricey, banks charge substantially for accepting open-ended risks even though banks demand a counter-indemnity from the Consignee. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The concern is how long should the Letter of Indemnity (LOI) for Missing Bills of Lading (B/L) remain valid because the Carrier’s (Shipowner or Ship Operator) absolute obligation to deliver cargo against the Original Bills of Lading (B/L) means that delivery to the wrong party becomes the Tort of Conversion which would leave the Tortfeasor liable for the whole value of the consignment. In most cases, this problem is solved when the Original Bills of Lading (B/L) eventually is received and the Original Bills of Lading (B/L) are then exchanged for the Letter of Indemnity (LOI) which is duly canceled thus extinguishing the bank’s liability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Irrevocably Lost Bill of Lading (B/L)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;irrevocably-lost-bill-of-lading-bl&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#irrevocably-lost-bill-of-lading-bl&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In some rare cases, when the Bills of Lading (B/L) have become irrevocably lost and the statute of limitations for the tort of conversion is six (6) years. Nevertheless, it is seldom, if ever that a Carrier (Shipowner or Ship Operator) demands the Letter of Indemnity (LOI) remain valid for all that time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prudent Ship Agents obtain the Principal’s agreement to accept a Letter of Indemnity (LOI) for Missing Bills of Lading (B/L) because there is &lt;strong&gt;no protection from the Himalaya Clause&lt;/strong&gt; for Tort of Conversion. Therefore, if the Ship Agent accepts a Letter of Indemnity (LOI) without reference to the Principal and things go wrong, it is the Ship Agent who will face the claim in Tort.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Electronic Bill of Lading (B/L)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;electronic-bill-of-lading-bl&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#electronic-bill-of-lading-bl&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The more instantaneous shipment of cargo means that the possibilities are continually increasing for the cargo arriving well before the Bills of Lading (B/L) have worked their way through the banking system. Many initiatives are striving to solve this issue by the use of Electronic Bills of Lading (B/L) alternative to traditional Paper Bills of Lading (B/L). Today, it is possible for a Shipper to receive all the information it needs via the internet or telephone lines. Furthermore, most combined transport operators process cargo arrangements via the internet. A Shipowner could give irrevocable instructions to a Carrier to hold cargo for the disposition of a Named Consignee, who would then be entitled to receive the cargo at the port of destination exclusively based on the instruction and without the necessity to produce any document. Security is accomplished by issuing to each consignee a unique Private Key putting the holder in the same position as if the Consignee had possession of the Original Bills of Lading (B/L). The significant issue still rests with the use of Letters of Credit (L/C) and the need to authorize selling cargo on without any loss of security. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Three Original Bills of Lading (B/L)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;three-originalbills-of-lading-bl&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#three-originalbills-of-lading-bl&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Generally, Shippers require three (3) Original Bills of Lading (B/L). In this case, if any one of the Original Bills of Lading (B/L) is being accomplished the others shall be void. The Letter of Credit (L/C) requires all three (3) Original Bills of Lading (B/L) before paying out because banks would not have security for payment if one of the Original Bills of Lading (B/L) is other than in the bank’s possession.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;History of Three Original Bills of Lading (B/L)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;history-of-three-originalbills-of-lading-bl&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#history-of-three-originalbills-of-lading-bl&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;A manuscript written in 1686 (Malnes Les Mercantoria) commented: “of the Bills of Lading (B/L) there is customarily three Bills of one tenor. One of them is enclosed in the letters carried by the same ship; another Bill is sent overland to the Factor or Party to whom the goods are consigned; the third remaineth with the Merchant, for his testimony against the Ship Master if there were any occasion or loose dealing”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1934, Lord Blackburn wrote: “I have never been able to learn why merchants and shipowners continue the practice of making out a Bill of Lading (B/L) in parts. I should have thought that every purpose would be answered by making out one Bill of Lading (B/L) only which should be the sole Document of Title”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, traditionally, the banks resume directing to a “full set of three (3) shipped on board Bills of Lading (B/L)”. Therefore, all three (3) Original Bills of Lading (B/L) have to be presented when negotiating the Letter of Credit (L/C). Old traditions die hard in the shipping business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hague-Visby Rules and Bill of Lading (B/L)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;hague-visby-rules-and-bill-of-lading-bl&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#hague-visby-rules-and-bill-of-lading-bl&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;At beginning of the 19th century, many complicated negligence clauses were incorporated by Shipowners into their Bills of Lading (B/L). These negligence clauses were drafted completely to defeat the effect of legal decisions against the Shipowners. Many of these clauses were drafted in an exceptionally ambiguous tone and were quite incomprehensible to interpret, as a result, the position of many Charterers, Shippers, Bankers, and Cargo Underwriters became ludicrous because they were unable to comprehend and interpret the extent of their rights against the Carrier (Shipowner or Ship Operator) in the carriage of cargo by sea. Therefore, a uniform international approach to all Bills of Lading (B/L) was needed, to reconcile the interests of all parties involved in the carriage of cargo by sea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1893, the United States of America (USA) passed the &lt;strong&gt;Harter Act&lt;/strong&gt;. Harter Act stipulated many conditions upon which cargoes were shipped to and from the United States of America (USA). Identical legislation was introduced by other governments to correct this unfair situation, such as Australia, which developed its Sea Carriage of Goods Act 1904, and Canada which passed The Water Carriage of Goods Act 1910.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1921, a set of regulations was drafted by the Maritime Law Committee of the International Law Association at a meeting at the Hague. These draft rules, subsequently known as the &lt;strong&gt;Hague Rules&lt;/strong&gt; were the subject of negotiation and amendment which culminated in their being incorporated in an International Convention that was signed in Brussels on 25th August 1924 by the major trading governments. Most of the participating governments introduced laws to give effect to the Hague Rules. Therefore, the United Kingdom enacted the &lt;strong&gt;Carriage of Goods by Sea Act 1924&lt;/strong&gt;. The introduction of containerization created dissatisfaction with the limitations of the Hague Rules. Hague Rules were amended by The Brussels Protocol of 1968 and became known as the &lt;strong&gt;Hague-Visby Rules&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The preponderance of the maritime governments ratified the Hague-Visby Rules. To give effect to the Hague-Visby Rules, the United Kingdom enacted the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act 1971. &lt;strong&gt;Carriage of Goods by Sea Act 1971&lt;/strong&gt; repeals the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act 1924 entirety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hague-Visby Rules&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;hague-visby-rules&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#hague-visby-rules&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Hague-Visby Rules apply to all contracts of carriage which are evidenced by a **Bills of Lading (B/L) **or a similar **Document of Title (DOT) **where:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a- Bill of Lading (B/L) is issued in the United Kingdom, or,&lt;br&gt;
b- Shipment from a port within the United Kingdom&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the Hague-Visby Rules apply to other such contracts of carriage evidenced by a Bill of Lading (B/L) if &lt;strong&gt;expressly incorporated&lt;/strong&gt;. Therefore, even if the port of shipment is from a nation that has not incorporated the Hague-Visby Rules into its legislation, the Hague-Visby Rules are applicable if the Hague-Visby Rules are **expressly incorporated **in the Bill of Lading (B/L).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;**The Hague-Visby Rules particularly refer to Bills of Lading (B/L) or other Documents of Title (DOT). The Hague-Visby Rules do not apply to Charterparties.  **&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, if a Bill of Lading (B/L) is issued in respect of a ship under a Charterparty, the Hague-Visby Rules will apply to the contract evidence by the Bill of Lading (B/L). Therefore, if a Bill of Lading (B/L) is issued to a Charterer within the Charterparty as **evidence **or **receipt **only for the cargo, &lt;strong&gt;the Hague-Visby Rules are not applicable&lt;/strong&gt;. However, if the Charterer endorses that Bill of Lading (B/L) in favor of an Endorsee, the Hague-Visby Rules will then govern the relationship between the Charterer and the Endorsee and are applicable from the point of endorsement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clause Paramount&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;clause-paramount&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#clause-paramount&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The parties to a Charterparty may stipulate that all Bills of Lading (B/L) issued under it shall be governed by the &lt;strong&gt;Hague-Visby Rules (Clause Paramount)&lt;/strong&gt; therefore the Hague-Visby Rules will apply even if the shipment does not originate from a country that has adopted the Hague-Visby Rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;**Hague-Visby Rules and Sea Waybills **&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;hague-visby-rules-and-sea-waybills&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#hague-visby-rules-and-sea-waybills&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The expression Contract of Carriage applies only to Contracts of Carriage governed by a Bill of Lading (B/L) or similar Documents of Title (DOT). A &lt;strong&gt;Non-Negotiable Receipt&lt;/strong&gt; will not necessarily be a Bill of Lading (B/L). Therefore, Sea Waybills expressly stipulate that the Hague-Visby Rules will apply. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The phrase &lt;strong&gt;Carrier&lt;/strong&gt; as used in the Hague-Visby Rules indicates either the &lt;strong&gt;Shipowner&lt;/strong&gt; or the &lt;strong&gt;Time Charterer&lt;/strong&gt; who contracts with the Shipper. Therefore, the Carrier can be sued by the &lt;strong&gt;Bills of Lading (B/L) Holder&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hague-Visby Rules** do not** apply to carriage or storage before the port of loading or after the port of discharge because that would be inland and not sea carriage. However, if the cargo is discharged and stored at an intermediate port before transshipment to another ship, the Hague-Visby Rules apply during the period of storage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carrier (Shipowner or Ship Operator) is entitled to enter into any contract stipulation condition reservation or exemption as to the responsibility and liability of the Carrier (Shipowner or Ship Operator) or the ship for loss of or damage to or in connection with the custody and care and handling of the cargo before the loading on and after the discharge from, the ship on which the cargo is carried by sea. Once the Hague-Visby Rules apply the parties may not change their provisions by contract save in respect of deleting excepted perils or increasing the limit of liability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Functions of the Hague-Visby Rules&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;functions-of-the-hague-visby-rules&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#functions-of-the-hague-visby-rules&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A- Hague-Visby Rules set out the &lt;strong&gt;obligations&lt;/strong&gt; of both parties (Carrier and Shipper), especially the Carrier (Shipowner or Ship Operator) for whom Hague-Visby Rules list the minimum statutory requirements imposed upon the Carrier (Shipowner or Ship Operator) in the undertaking of international business.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;B- Hague-Visby Rules set out where a Carrier (Shipowner or Ship Operator) &lt;strong&gt;may exempt himself from liability&lt;/strong&gt; as a consequence of one of the exceptions embodied in the Hague-Visby Rules. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;C- Hague-Visby Rules define the &lt;strong&gt;limits of the Carrier’s (Shipowner or Ship Operator) liability&lt;/strong&gt;. The shipper should not consider the Carrier (Shipowner or Ship Operator) as the insurer of his cargo. A prudent Shipper would cover himself from loss or damage to the cargo by taking out an all-risks policy. Any claim to be pursued against the Carrier (Shipowner or Ship Operator) would then be undertaken by the Cargo Insurers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Important Parts of the Hague-Visby Rules&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;important-parts-of-the-hague-visby-rules&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#important-parts-of-the-hague-visby-rules&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;**Hague-Visby Rules Article I:  **Specifies the definitions of the phrase Carrier and Contract of Carriage. Hague-Visby Rules apply exclusively to Contracts of Carriage covered by a Bill of Lading (B/L). Hague-Visby Rules clarify the position of Bill of Lading (B/L) issued under a Charterparty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hague-Visby Rules Article I Rule (1c):&lt;/strong&gt; Hague-Visby Rules do not cover live animals. Furthermore, Hague-Visby Rules do not cover deck cargo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To avoid liability the Bills of Lading (B/L) must undoubtedly remark “loaded on deck at shipper’s risk”. If the cargo is loaded on deck but this is not stated on the Bills of Lading (B/L), the full force of the Hague-Visby Rules will apply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;**Hague-Visby Rules Article III Rule (1): **Before the Hague-Visby Rules were introduced the situation was that in every contract of carriage by sea there was implied an absolute warranty of seaworthiness throughout the sea voyage. The Hague-Visby Rules require that the Shipowners shall &lt;strong&gt;exercise due diligence&lt;/strong&gt; to make the ship seaworthy &lt;strong&gt;before and at the beginning of the sea voyage&lt;/strong&gt;. Furthermore, The Hague-Visby Rules require that the Shipowners shall properly man and equip the ship and also make the holds &lt;strong&gt;cargoworthy&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The phrase &lt;strong&gt;exercise due diligence&lt;/strong&gt; may not be taken lightly, it is a personal obligation upon the Shipowner and may be considered &lt;strong&gt;a duty of care&lt;/strong&gt;. Shipowners’ duty of care cannot be delegated. Shipowners cannot abdicate their responsibility to a third party.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Riverstone Meat Co. v. Lancashire Shipping Co. Case 1961, Riverstone Meat Co. (Plaintiff) contracted with the Lancashire Shipping Co. (Defendant) to ship 150 cases of canned ox tongue from Sydney to London aboard Lancashire Shipping’s controlled MV Muncaster Castle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cargo was damaged by seawater. Some months earlier the MV Muncaster Castle underwent a load line survey which was carried out by a reputable firm of surveyors under the supervision of Lloyds Register (LR). After the survey the inspection covers on the storm valves had not been properly tightened by the fitter, therefore, seawater was allowed to enter the hold. The case went all the way to the House of Lords where Lord Radcliffe, in concurring with the judgment against the shipowner Lancashire Shipping Co. (Defendant) made the practical point that it would not make sense for the Riverstone Meat Co. (Plaintiff) to go chasing after contractors and sub-contractors working for the shipowner Lancashire Shipping Co. (Defendant), it was up to the shipowner Lancashire Shipping Co. (Defendant) to cover himself by obtaining satisfactory indemnities from those doing work for the shipowner. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hague-Visby Rules demand that if the shipowner has provided an appropriately qualified crew of appropriate size at the beginning of the sea voyage, the shipowner has fulfilled his obligation even if the crew’s subsequent incompetence causes issues to arise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hague-Visby Rules Article III Rule 2:&lt;/strong&gt; Requires the Carrier (Shipowner or Ship Operator) to look after the cargo properly. Hague-Visby Rules Article III Rule 2 draws attention to Article IV (exceptions) this is a continuous obligation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hague-Visby Rules Article III Rule 3****and Rule 4:&lt;/strong&gt; Specify the requirement to issue a Bill of Lading (B/L). Bill of Lading (B/L) must indicate the quantity, and apparent condition of the cargo as well as how the cargo can be efficiently identified. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hague-Visby Rules Article III Rule 5:&lt;/strong&gt; Specifies obligations upon the Shipper to guarantee the accuracy of the cargo details supplied. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hague-Visby Rules Article III Rule 6:&lt;/strong&gt; Specify the time bar. Hague-Visby Rules Article III Rule 6 notes that any loss or damage has to be notified within three (3) days of taking delivery of the cargo. Hague-Visby Rules Article III Rule 6 stipulates that the “ship will be discharged from all liability unless suit is brought within one (1) year”. The phrase “suit is brought” goes beyond merely claiming writing, court action has to be started. Hague-Visby Rules Article III Rule 6 provides for the parties to extend the time limit by mutual agreement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hague-Visby Rules Article III Rule 6bis:&lt;/strong&gt; Authorizes the Carrier to commence an action for indemnity against a third party even after the one-year time limit provided for in the preceding paragraph if brought within the time allowed by the law of the court seized with the case. Nevertheless, the time allowed shall not be less than three (3) months, starting from the day when the person bringing such an action for indemnity has settled the claim or has been served with process in the action against himself. This addition to Hague-Visby Rules Article III Rule 6 was added to overcome the issues experienced by Carriers who sub-contract all or part of the carriage but remain principally liable to the trader for the performance of the contract because of the absence of any demise clause in the Bill of Lading (B/L). If a claim is made or court action is commenced against such a Carrier at the last minute the Carrier would otherwise have little or no time within which to protect his right of recourse against the sub-contracting Carrier. The addition gives the main Carrier at least three (3) months in which the main Carrier can either settle the claim by amicable agreement or proceed against the sub-contractor. Hague-Visby Rules Article III Rule 6bis can be useful in the case of a container carrier using a Combined Transport Bill of Lading (B/L) where the loss or damage is caused by a feeder ship       &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hague-Visby Rules Article****IV Rule 1:&lt;/strong&gt; Reiterates the due diligence requirement and this is followed by the various exceptions included in Hague-Visby Rules Article IV Rule 2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hague-Visby Rules Article IV Rule 2a is an important exception that covers acts of negligence or default by those employed by the Shipowner in the navigation or management of the ship. Hague-Visby Rules Article IV Rule 2a emphasizes that the shipowner delivers officers and crew of correct numbers and properly qualified, if their acts or omissions cause damage to the cargo, the shipowner is not liable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hague-Visby Rules Article****IV Rule 3:&lt;/strong&gt; Provides the Shipper some degree of similar protection for their errors and omissions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;**Hague-Visby Rules Article****IV Rule 4: **Deviation Clause which goes beyond the Common Law restrictions. Hague-Visby Rules Article IV Rule 4 allows deviation to save property as well as life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hague-Visby Rules Article****IV Rule 5:&lt;/strong&gt; Specify the significant financial limitations of liability based on Special Drawing Rights (SDRs) which is a unit of account devised by the International Monetary Fund (IMF). The rate of exchange of any currency can be established against Special Drawing Rights (SDRs). The financial limitation payments are 666,67 units of account per package or 2 units of account per kilo whichever is the highest. Issues have arisen as to what includes a package when a sealed FCL (Full Container Load) is involved. The Carrier has no way of verifying how many individual items are in the container which is why care is taken to include the terms &lt;strong&gt;Said to Contain&lt;/strong&gt; when drafting Bills of Lading (B/L) for FCL (Full Container Load) containers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hague-Visby Rules Article&lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;IV Rule&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;5(a):&lt;/strong&gt; Allows for the minimum level of limitation to be increased above that provided by the Shipper expressly declaring a higher value before shipment and ensuring this is inserted in the Bills of Lading (B/L).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hague-Visby Rules Article&lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;IV Rule&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;6:&lt;/strong&gt; Highlights the Carrier’s right to deal with undeclared dangerous cargo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hague-Visby Rules Article****IV bis:&lt;/strong&gt; Stipulates Himalaya Clause and provides servants or agents of the Carrier the same protection and limitations as in the contract should a claim be made against them in tort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hague-Visby Rules Article****V:&lt;/strong&gt; Ensures that the Hague-Visby Rules do not prevent the insertion of any provision about the General Average (GA).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hague-Visby Rules Article****VI:&lt;/strong&gt; Allows the Hague-Visby Rules to be incorporated into documents that are not the Bills of Lading (B/L) such as Sea Waybills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hague-Visby Rules Article VII:&lt;/strong&gt; Allows the Hague-Visby Rules to be extended to care or handling of the cargo before and/or after carriage by sea. Hague-Visby Rules Article VII is an important rule in the container business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hague-Visby Rules Article&lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;VIII and Article&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;IX:&lt;/strong&gt; Deal with the Hague-Visby Rules not affecting rights and obligations under statutes in force and do not affect compliance with any international agreement concerning nuclear damage.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hague-Visby Rules Article****X:&lt;/strong&gt; Expresses that Hague-Visby Rules apply to contract states and any contract when the parties choose to incorporate the Hague-Visby Rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hague-Visby Rules solely apply if the Bills of Lading (B/L) are issued in a contracting state or the carriage is from a port in a contracting state. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;**Hamburg Rules and Bill of Lading (B/L) **&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;hamburg-rules-and-bill-of-lading-bl&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#hamburg-rules-and-bill-of-lading-bl&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1978, UNCTAD (United Nations Conference on Trade and Development) drafted a convention entitled Hamburg Rules. Hamburg Rules came into effect on 1st November 1992 which was the date when Hamburg Rules achieved ratification by its twentieth countries; none of the signatories is a prominent maritime nation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hamburg Rules mark topics in the Hague-Visby Rules which, in the drafters’ views, are least favorable to cargo-owning nations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is the difference between Hague Visby Rules and Hamburg Rules?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;what-is-the-difference-between-hague-visby-rules-and-hamburg-rules&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#what-is-the-difference-between-hague-visby-rules-and-hamburg-rules&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The difference between Hamburg Rules and Hague-Visby Rules is that&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hamburg Rules apply to any contract of carriage by sea against payment of freight except a Charterparty. Unlike Hague-Visby Rules, there is no question of restricting Hamburg Rules to Bills of Lading (B/L).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next significant difference is that the Hamburg Rules apply whether the cargo is loaded or discharged in a contracting nation. If the cargo is loaded in a Hague-Visby Rules nation, the Shippers expect Hague-Visby Rules to apply but if the destination is in a Hamburg Rules nation, the Receivers may insist on their Hamburg Rules with cargo claims arising at the discharging port.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, Hamburg Rules sweep aside most exceptions in Hague-Visby Rules. Hamburg Rules mandate the Carrier to prove that the Carrier took all measures to prevent loss or damage to the cargo. In practice, most of the exceptions in the Hague-Visby Rules are beyond the control of the Carrier so Hamburg Rules appear not harsh except that the Hamburg Rules introduce liability for delay. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The financial limits of liability that the Hamburg Rules introduced are higher than Hague-Visby Rules. Hamburg Rules stipulate 835 units of account per package or 2.3 units of account per kilo. Furthermore, Hamburg Rules stipulate two and a half times the freight in the case of delay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neither Deck Cargo nor Animals are excluded from the Hamburg Rules although the Carrier is not liable for special risks in the case of animals&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other significant change from Hague-Visby Rules is that the time bar under Hamburg Rules is two (2) years rather than one (1) year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hague-Visby Rules have been tested in the courts for many years. Therefore, there is a general objection to the Hamburg Rules by the maritime nations. Much of the wording in the Hamburg Rules is indicative of diplomatic compromise rather than legal consideration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, there is a widespread sentiment that the Hague-Visby Rules require an additional amendment to bring the Hague-Visby Rules into line with modern shipping requirements and concerns. Currently, only five percent (5%) of global trade is represented under Hamburg Rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Carriage of Goods by Sea Act 1992&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;carriage-ofgoods-by-sea-act-1992&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#carriage-ofgoods-by-sea-act-1992&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the United Kingdom, the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act 1971 is the ratification of the Hague-Visby Rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act 1992 is the Act that replaces the United Kingdom Bills of Lading Act 1855. The Carriage of Goods by Sea Act 1992 does not replace the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act 1971 Act. Many practitioners in the shipping business think that a less confusing title could have been found for the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act 1992. Furthermore, the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act 1992 covers documents other than Bills of Lading (B/L) such as Sea Waybills. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Carriage of Goods by Sea Act 1992 is the Act that replaces the United Kingdom Bills of Lading Act 1855. Other countries have their legislation covering Bills of Lading (B/L).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bills of Lading Act 1855&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;bills-of-lading-act-1855&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#bills-of-lading-act-1855&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bills of Lading Act 1855 was overdue for emendation because the Bills of Lading Act 1855 had certain drawbacks when the Bills of Lading (B/L) were transferred. Furthermore, the Bills of Lading Act 1855 could not cope with some present-day procedures. Nevertheless, for many years the Bills of Lading Act 1855 stood the test of time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Assignment of Contracts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;assignment-of-contracts&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#assignment-of-contracts&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;An assignment is a device that allows one party (Assignor) to transfer the benefit of a performance that one party (Assignor) has contracted to receive to another person in such a way that the Assignee may enforce performance. In this case, the original contract does not stipulate that the benefit of performance should go to a third party. An** involuntary assignment **by operation of law may occur upon death or bankruptcy. Nevertheless, the common law initially made no provision for the &lt;strong&gt;voluntary assignment&lt;/strong&gt; of contracts. The doctrine of privity prevents an individual who is not a party to the contract from suing upon that contract.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Assignment of Contract of Carriage (Charterparty)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;assignment-of-contract-of-carriage-charterparty&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#assignment-of-contract-of-carriage-charterparty&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before the Bills of Lading Act 1855, Under Common Law, when a Bill of Lading (B/L) was issued and passed to the Consignee with the explicit intention of passing the property in the cargo, it did not transfer the rights and liabilities under the contract of carriage to the Consignee. Practically, this would cause a significant problem as the Consignee would have no contractual recourse against the Carrier (Shipowner or Ship Operator) if the cargo was damaged or delayed. The Bills of Lading Act 1855 altered this issue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bills of Lading Act 1855 Section 1:&lt;/strong&gt; stipulates that when property in the cargo passes upon or because of an endorsement, the contractual rights of suit and contractual liabilities are transferred to the Endorsee. Bills of Lading (B/L) may only be transferred to another party if Bills of Lading (B/L) is drafted &lt;strong&gt;To Order&lt;/strong&gt; and so that the property in cargo may pass by assignment of the Bills of Lading (B/L), the subsequent prerequisites must be fulfilled: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1- The cargo must be in transit&lt;br&gt;
2- The Bills of Lading (B/L) must be transferable on the face of it&lt;br&gt;
3- The Bills of Lading (B/L) must have been put in circulation by someone who had a good title to the cargo&lt;br&gt;
4- There must have been an intention to transfer the property&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sheer endorsement and delivery of Bills of Lading (B/L) by way of deposit, for instance to a bank in a Letter of Credit (L/C) transaction, did not pass the property in the cargo to an Endorsee to make the Endorsee liable on the contract in the Bills of Lading (B/L). For the Bills of Lading Act 1855 to apply it is not necessary for the property in the cargo to pass at the same time as the endorsement of the Bills of Lading (B/L). If the contemporaneous transfer of property and the Bills of Lading (B/L) were required then the Bills of Lading Act 1855 would be rendered useless in a considerable number of cases where the contract of sale stipulates the point at which property in the cargo to pass which moment may well be one other than the time of transfer of the Bills of Lading (B/L). When the Shipper retained the proprietary right in the cargo, the Shipper would also retain the rights of suit against the Shipowner under the contract in the Bills of Lading (B/L). In this case, the Bills of Lading Act 1855 could barely be construed as intending to take those rights from the Shipper and transfer them to the Endorsee, in this case, the bankers. If the proprietary rights and the rights of the suit are not transferred, neither would the liabilities under the contract.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bills of Lading Act 1855 Section 2:&lt;/strong&gt; stipulates the right of the Shipowner to claim freight from the actual Shipper although the Bills of Lading (B/L) may have been assigned by him. Furthermore, Bills of Lading Act 1855 Section 2 preserves the right of the actual Shipper to stop the cargo in transit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bills of Lading Act 1855 Section 3:&lt;/strong&gt; stipulates that in the hands of the Consignee, the Bills of Lading (B/L) is definitive evidence of shipment as against the Ship Master or Ship Agent signing the Bills of Lading (B/L).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the functions of the Bills of Lading (B/L) is to act as a &lt;strong&gt;Receipt&lt;/strong&gt; for the cargo shipped. At Common Law, the Bills of Lading (B/L) are regarded as being &lt;strong&gt;Prima Facie&lt;/strong&gt; evidence that the quantity of cargo alleged to have been shipped has been shipped. Nevertheless, the Shipowner is entitled to prove that the cargo was never shipped. If the Shipowner proves that, the Shipowner will escape liability in respect of the cargo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prima Facie evidence is evidence at first sight only, which may be disputed by the party against whom the evidence is offered. In Grant v Norway (1851) Case, a Bill of Lading (B/L) was signed by the Ship Master for twelve (12) bales of silk, which the Shipowner proved had not been loaded on board. It was held that the Ship Master had no authority to sign for cargo not shipped and the Bill of Lading (B/L) Holder had no claim against the Shipowner for non-delivery of these bales&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bills of Lading Act 1855 Section 3 stipulates that the Bills of Lading (B/L) should be conclusive evidence that the cargo represented to have been shipped was in fact shipped. Bills of Lading Act 1855 Section 3 does not create actual liability on the part of the person who signed the Bills of Lading (B/L) if the cargo was in fact not shipped. Therefore, the ability of the Consignee and the Endorsee, to sue on the contract of carriage, was dependent upon the property in the cargo being vested in them upon the transfer of the Bills of Lading (B/L). Consequently, the Bills of Lading Act 1855 formed a marriage between entitlement to sue on the Bills of Lading (B/L) contract and property in the cargo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Aliakmon (1986) Case, the cargo of steel suffered damage due to inappropriate stowage. At that moment, the risk but not the actual property had passed to the CIF Buyer (Cost, Freight, Insurance). As there was no privity of contract between the CIF Buyer and the Carrier, the CIF Buyer could not sue under contract and therefore tried to sue under tort. The case failed because it was held that the Carrier had no duty of care towards the CIF Buyer as the CIF Buyer was not the owner of the cargo at the moment of the alleged negligence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Carriage of Goods by Sea Act 1992&lt;/strong&gt; divorces the ‘marriage formed by the Bills of Lading Act 1855 between property in the cargo and right to sue on the contract of carriage. Under the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act 1992, the lawful Bill of Lading (B/L) Holder (Section 2 (1) (a)) or the person to whom the goods are to be delivered under a Sea Waybill (Section 2 (1) (b)) (who was excluded from the ambit of Section 1 of the Bills of Lading Act 1855) or the person to whom the goods are to be delivered under a ship’s delivery order (Section 2 (1) (c)) can sue on the contract of carriage as if he had been a party to that contract.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carriage of Goods by Sea Act 1992 stipulates that with the current speed of ships, it is not unusual for the cargo to be correctly delivered against a Letter of Indemnity (LOI). In this case, at the time of delivery, the Consignee is not in actual possession of the Bill of Lading (B/L), and by the time the Bill of Lading (B/L) reaches the Consignee, Bill of Lading (B/L) will have ceased to be a Document of Title (DOT) because the cargo will no longer be in transit.     &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carriage of Goods by Sea Act 1992 separates the title to sue from the passing of the property in the cargo; lawful possession of the Bill of Lading (B/L) is sufficient. Even actual possession is not necessary provided that the measures taken to transfer the Bill of Lading (B/L) were made before the Bill of Lading (B/L) ceased to be a Document of Title (DOT).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carriage of Goods by Sea Act 1992, after listing the Bill of Lading (B/L) Holder or the person to whom delivery is to be made under a Sea Waybill or ship delivery order then stipulates “shall have transferred to and vested in him all rights of suit under the contract of carriage as if he had been a party to that contract” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act 1992, with rights come liabilities, and the person who demands delivery under a Bill of Lading (B/L), Sea Waybill, or Ship Delivery Order becomes subject to the same liabilities as the original Shipper which may possess obligations to pay the freight, demurrage, etc. These liabilities are not imposed on a party who merely holds the Bill of Lading (B/L) as security for payment, such as a bank.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act 1992, a Bill of Lading (B/L) is deemed conclusive evidence of such shipment against the Carrier which appears to overrule the Grant V Norway (1851) Case. &lt;/p&gt;

      <description>
        
        
        &lt;h2&gt;A broker has a number of responsibilities to their principal, including:&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;a-broker-has-a-number-of-responsibilities-to-their-principal-including&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#a-broker-has-a-number-of-responsibilities-to-their-principal-including&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Loyalty:&lt;/strong&gt; The broker must act in the best interests of their principal at all times. This means avoiding any conflicts of interest and not disclosing confidential information to third parties.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Skill and care:&lt;/strong&gt; The broker must exercise a reasonable degree of skill and care in carrying out their duties. This includes keeping up to date with market developments and providing accurate information to their principal.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Transparency:&lt;/strong&gt; The broker must be transparent with their principal about their fees and any other commissions they may be earning. They must also disclose any potential conflicts of interest.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Accountability:&lt;/strong&gt; The broker is accountable to their principal for their actions. If the broker breaches any of their duties, their principal may be able to sue them for damages.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Here are some specific examples of the broker&amp;rsquo;s responsibilities to the principal in the context of ship chartering:&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;here-are-some-specific-examples-of-the-brokers-responsibilities-to-the-principal-in-the-context-of-ship-chartering&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#here-are-some-specific-examples-of-the-brokers-responsibilities-to-the-principal-in-the-context-of-ship-chartering&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The broker must identify and source suitable ships for the charterer that meet their specific requirements.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The broker must negotiate the charter contract on behalf of the charterer, securing the best possible terms and conditions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The broker must keep the charterer informed of market developments and any potential risks to their charter.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The broker must monitor the vessel&amp;rsquo;s performance and ensure that the shipowner is meeting their obligations under the charter contract.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The broker must resolve any disputes that may arise between the charterer and the shipowner.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The broker&amp;rsquo;s responsibilities to the principal are governed by a number of factors, including the terms of the agency agreement between the broker and the principal, the law of the jurisdiction in which the broker is operating, and any relevant industry codes of conduct.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is important for both the broker and the principal to be aware of their respective rights and responsibilities. This will help to ensure that the chartering process is conducted smoothly and efficiently.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Calculation of Demurrage</title>
      <link>https://www.anirbanmarine.in/docs/partc/em303/cshipmgmt/demurrcalc/</link>

        &lt;h1&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Calculation of Demurrage&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How are Demurrage Charges calculated?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;how-are-demurrage-charges-calculated&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#how-are-demurrage-charges-calculated&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;strong&gt;calculation of demurrage&lt;/strong&gt; amount payable to shipowner, demurrage rate is multiplied by the &lt;strong&gt;number of days&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;part of day&lt;/strong&gt; in &lt;strong&gt;excess&lt;/strong&gt; of the &lt;strong&gt;agreed laytime&lt;/strong&gt;. For example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Total Laytime Allowed 11 days&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Demurrage Rate $60,000 per day pro rata (PDPR)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ship exceeded laytime allowed for loading and discharging by 4 days 6 hours 30 mins&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Demurrage Payable&lt;/strong&gt; =4d 6h 30m x $60,000 per day =4.27083 days x $60,000 = $256,250&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to arrive at the &lt;strong&gt;number of days on demurrage,&lt;/strong&gt; a calculation of the time in port must be made making reference to the &lt;strong&gt;time allowed (laytime)&lt;/strong&gt; and whether time is counting or whether it is an exception and does not count. Demurrage calculation is similar to using a stopwatch in that the clock will continue to run until there is a qualifying exception and the time will stop. Therefore, in any charter-party it is important to know exactly &lt;strong&gt;when the agreed laytime has expired&lt;/strong&gt; as the ship, from that point, ship will be &lt;strong&gt;on demurrage&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;‘Once on Demurrage, Always on Demurrage’&lt;/strong&gt; phrase is sometimes overused and often misleading. It is crucial to note that the rules for the &lt;strong&gt;stopwatch&lt;/strong&gt; change when a ship is on demurrage and careful attention must be paid to the &lt;strong&gt;detail of the specific charter-party&lt;/strong&gt; when this happens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;General rule is that &lt;strong&gt;express exceptions&lt;/strong&gt; to laytime &lt;strong&gt;do not apply to demurrage&lt;/strong&gt; unless there is &lt;strong&gt;clear wording&lt;/strong&gt; in the charter-party to that effect. Theoretically, the clock &lt;strong&gt;does not&lt;/strong&gt; stop running once the ship has gone on demurrage,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, Asbatankvoy – Clause 7 last sentence reads as follows: Time consumed by the ship in moving from loading or discharge port anchorage to her loading or discharge berth, discharging ballast water or slops, will &lt;strong&gt;not count&lt;/strong&gt; as used lay time. If the ship was moving from the anchorage to the berth and the laytime at that time had &lt;strong&gt;not been used up&lt;/strong&gt; then time will &lt;strong&gt;not run&lt;/strong&gt; during the period of &lt;strong&gt;moving to the berth.&lt;/strong&gt; On the other hand, if &lt;strong&gt;lay time had expired&lt;/strong&gt; and the &lt;strong&gt;ship was on demurrage&lt;/strong&gt; then time would &lt;strong&gt;continue to run&lt;/strong&gt; for such an event and the owner is entitled to demurrage for this time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Great care must be taken over the &lt;strong&gt;wording of the charter-party&lt;/strong&gt; for events which &lt;strong&gt;interrupt laytime&lt;/strong&gt; to apply to demurrage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Demurrage &lt;strong&gt;would not run&lt;/strong&gt; where there is a &lt;strong&gt;fault on the part of the shipowner&lt;/strong&gt;. For example, a &lt;strong&gt;ship breakdown&lt;/strong&gt;, as shipowner &lt;strong&gt;should not be able to profit&lt;/strong&gt; (paid for demurrage) for his own breach of contract. &lt;strong&gt;General exceptions clauses&lt;/strong&gt; will &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; apply to demurrage unless the wording specifically supports this. &lt;strong&gt;Time on demurrage ends&lt;/strong&gt; at the same time as &lt;strong&gt;laytime&lt;/strong&gt; would have done, such as when &lt;strong&gt;completion of cargo operations&lt;/strong&gt; in dry bulk market or when disconnection of cargo hoses in the tanker market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When is Demurrage Payable?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;when-is-demurrage-payable&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#when-is-demurrage-payable&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gencon Charterpary (GENCON 94) Clause 7 states ‘Demurrage shall fall due day by day and shall be payable &lt;strong&gt;upon receipt of the owners’ invoice.’&lt;/strong&gt; In this case an owner is entitled to submit an invoice every day for as long as the vessel is on demurrage. Clearly where there are long delays and large amounts of demurrage incurred the owner may want to do so to ensure that the charterer becomes liable immediately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In practice a claim is submitted at the end of the voyage and, after a period of negotiating the details and amount, agreement is reached and one payment made for the entire claim. Absent the Gencon wording, it is generally accepted that demurrage is payable day by day. However some charterparties will include express terms about the timing of payment which will need to be examined on a case-by-case basis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is Demurrage?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;what-is-demurrage&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#what-is-demurrage&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Demurrage&lt;/strong&gt; refers to the &lt;strong&gt;liquidated damages payable by the charterers to the shipowner&lt;/strong&gt; for failing to complete the loading or discharging of the ship within the &lt;strong&gt;agreed laytime period.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Demurrage is not payable when the charter party expressly provides that certain periods of time lost, such as &lt;strong&gt;breakdown&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;inefficiency&lt;/strong&gt; of the ship, shall &lt;strong&gt;not count&lt;/strong&gt; for demurrage, However, the general rule is &lt;strong&gt;“once on demurrage, always on demurrage”&lt;/strong&gt; i.e., if a ship is on demurrage, no laytime exceptions such as Sundays and holidays can be deducted from the computation of demurrage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;–&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Demurrage Rate&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;demurrage-rate&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#demurrage-rate&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Demurrage is the name given to the damages payable by the Charterer to the Shipowner for the &lt;strong&gt;Charterer’s Breach of Charterparty&lt;/strong&gt; in delaying the ship beyond the agreed laytime. &lt;strong&gt;Demurrage is Liquidated Damages&lt;/strong&gt; that means the rate per day is fixed at the time the charterparty is agreed. Furthermore, Shipowners (Disponent Owners) and Charterters know in advance their respective liabilities/earnings in the event of a delay. This is distinct from Damages at Large which would require a Shipowner to prove his losses. For demurrage, the Shipowner only has to prove that the delay falls within the terms of demurrage for the relevant charterparty. The &lt;strong&gt;Demurrage Rate&lt;/strong&gt; agreed is much like the Freight Rate, &lt;strong&gt;Demurrage Rate&lt;/strong&gt; will be a reflection of the running costs of the ship and the market conditions. Usually, the &lt;strong&gt;Demurrage Rate&lt;/strong&gt; is agreed in the charterparty as a &lt;strong&gt;Daily Rate&lt;/strong&gt;. For part of a day, the rate is pro rated as.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Once on Demurrage, Always on Demurrage&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;once-on-demurrage-always-on-demurrage&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#once-on-demurrage-always-on-demurrage&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If a &lt;strong&gt;charterer detains the vessel beyond the agreed lay days&lt;/strong&gt;, then the charterer is in &lt;strong&gt;breach of contract&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The majority of charter-parties include a clause providing that he may retain the vessel for additional days in order to complete the loading or discharging operation on payment of a &lt;strong&gt;fixed daily amount&lt;/strong&gt;, known as &lt;strong&gt;demurrage&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the late nineteenth century this additional period was judicially referred to as &lt;strong&gt;lay days that have to be paid for&lt;/strong&gt;. This is a misleading description since it conceals the fact that, in reality, the charterer is in breach of contract even though he is entitled, on payment of the agreed rate, ‘to detain the ship for the purpose of enabling him, if possible, to perform his broken contract and so mitigate any further damage’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, it is an anomalous position since, despite the breach, the shipowner is unable to rescind the contract and withdraw his ship during the demurrage period unless the failure of the charterer to load amounts to a repudiation of the contract on his part, or the delay is so substantial as to frustrate the object of the charter-party. This principle applies whether the charter stipulates for a fixed number of days on demurrage or no time limit is expressed as, e.g., ‘eight days for loading, after which demurrage at £2,000 per diem’. At common law a demurrage clause is purely a creation of contract and is in the nature of a provision for agreed damages for detention of the vessel beyond the agreed lay days. The stipulated sum is recoverable by the shipowner irrespective of proof of damage, and represents the maximum amount recoverable for loss resulting from the detention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Demurrage&lt;/strong&gt; will thus cover losses of freight arising under subsequent charter-parties affected by the delay, or from the consequent reduction in the number of voyages possible under a consecutive voyage charter-party. On the other hand, it will not extend to limit claims for losses arising from causes other than detention as, for example, from failure to load a full cargo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As with any other provision for &lt;strong&gt;liquidated damages&lt;/strong&gt;, a &lt;strong&gt;demurrage clause&lt;/strong&gt; may be struck down by the courts as a penalty if the rate is fixed so high as to be &lt;strong&gt;extravagant&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;unconscionable&lt;/strong&gt; in comparison with the greatest possible loss that could flow from the breach. In such circumstances the courts would consider the shipowner adequately compensated by being allowed to recover his actual loss. A similar principle would not appear to be applicable in reverse in cases where the rate is fixed at an &lt;strong&gt;unreasonably low level&lt;/strong&gt;. In such an event the shipowner is unable to recover his actual loss but is limited to the &lt;strong&gt;specified demurrage rate&lt;/strong&gt; even though the delay has been deliberately caused by the charterer for his own benefit. Such a situation may be open to abuse at times when costs and freight rates are rising and the shipowner may be left without an effective remedy should excessive delay result in him losing a subsequent charter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The actual rate of demurrage will be stated in the charter-party and will normally be fixed at a figure in line with current freight rates at the time of the conclusion of the charter. As such fixtures are often made well in advance, the figure may bear little resemblance to prevailing freight rates by the time demurrage becomes payable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Liability for the payment of demurrage accrues immediately on the expiration of the lay days and runs continuously&lt;/strong&gt; through Sundays, holidays and other periods normally excluded from laytime, e.g. bad weather working days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rule is &lt;strong&gt;once on demurrage, always on demurrage&lt;/strong&gt;. For a similar reason, laytime exceptions are held not to be applicable to a demurrage period unless expressly worded to that effect. Thus in a case in which the &lt;strong&gt;House of Lords had refused to allow a charterer&lt;/strong&gt; to invoke a &lt;strong&gt;strike exception after laytime had expired&lt;/strong&gt;, Lord Reid justified the decision on the grounds that ‘the shipowner might well say: true, your breach of contract in detaining my ship after the end of laytime did not cause the strike, but if you had fulfilled your contract the strike would have caused no loss because my ship would have been on the high seas before it began: so it is more reasonable that you should bear the loss than that I should’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, the &lt;strong&gt;once on demurrage rule&lt;/strong&gt; may still apply even though the event covered by the exception occurs before the expiry of laytime. An exception can be &lt;strong&gt;expressly worded&lt;/strong&gt; so as to cover the demurrage period as, for example, where it was provided that demurrage was to be paid ‘at 12s 6d per hour unless detention arises from a lock-out, strikes etc.’ Similarly, demurrage will not accrue during a period where delay was due to the &lt;strong&gt;fault of the shipowner&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;resulted from action taken by&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;the shipowner&lt;/strong&gt; for his own convenience. It will, however, accrue where the delay is &lt;strong&gt;accidental&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;not due to the fault of either shipowner or charterer&lt;/strong&gt;. Even where the delay results from a breach of contract by the shipowner, demurrage may &lt;strong&gt;still be payable&lt;/strong&gt; if the length of such delay is beyond the reasonable contemplation of the parties as a possible consequence of the breach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Demurrage as Liquidated Damages&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;demurrage-as-liquidated-damages&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#demurrage-as-liquidated-damages&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It should be remembered that since demurrage represents the amounts which the Shipowners (Disponent Owners) and Charterers have agreed are &lt;strong&gt;payable by the Charterer&lt;/strong&gt; to the Shipowner to recompense it for any losses which it has suffered as a result of the &lt;strong&gt;detention of the ship beyond laytime&lt;/strong&gt;, it follows that the Shipowner may not be able to recover other losses which it has suffered as a result. These &lt;strong&gt;Liquidated Damages (Demurrage)&lt;/strong&gt; represent all the damages which can be recovered by the Shipowner where the laytime is exceeded. Therefore, the Shipowner (Disponent Owner) may not be able to recover extra bunkers or port costs incurred by it as a result of the delay or even the loss of a valuable next cargo (fixture) which is cancelled as a result of the delay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To recover other losses, the Shipowner must show that the charterer is also in breach of another provision of the charterparty. For example, in a case called Reider v Arcos (1926) Case, the Shipowner proved that, as a result of the charterer’s delay, the ship could not leave port with a full cargo because the depth of water over the bar had dropped. The charterer therefore loaded less cargo than it would have loaded if there had been no delay and the owner recovered deadfreight for the Charterer’s breach on top of demurrage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;**Ship Detention **&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;ship-detention&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#ship-detention&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Laytime is at the free disposal of the charterer&lt;/strong&gt; since he is regarded as having paid for it in the freight. He is entitled to use it in the way which suits him best and, provided that the agreed period is not exceeded, the shipowner is not entitled to complain that the cargo could have been loaded in a shorter time. ‘The method of loading  and discharging the ship is entirely a matter for the charterers to decide. Nor is it of any consequence to the owners whether the loading or discharge proceed very slowly on some days and exceptionally fast on others or at an even pace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All that matters to the owners is the actual time occupied by those operations.’ The most striking example of this principle in operation is to be found in the case of Margaronis Navigation Agency v Peabody where a vessel had been chartered  to load a full and complete cargo of maize at an average rate of 1,000 tons per weather working day of 24 hours, Sundays and holidays excepted. The charterers were required by the master to provide a cargo of 12,600 tons and when, by 5 p.m. on Friday, 27 December, all but 11 tons of this amount had been loaded, they instructed the stevedores to stop work as they were anxious for business reasons to obtain January bills of lading. Loading  was resumed at 8 a.m. on Tuesday, 2 January, the next working day in the port, and was completed in 40 minutes, after which the vessel sailed. Although the operation had been completed within the agreed lay-time, the shipowners nevertheless &lt;strong&gt;claimed damages for detention&lt;/strong&gt; on the  ground that &lt;strong&gt;the charterers had wrongfully detained the vessel for their own purposes&lt;/strong&gt; after a full cargo had been loaded. While admitting that the charterer’s obligation ‘was to load a full and complete cargo subject to the de minimis rule’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Court of Appeal nevertheless upheld the decision of the arbitrator that, in  view  of  the accuracy of the loading equipment being used, a shortage of approximately 12 tons (i.e. less than 0.01 per cent) was &lt;strong&gt;not a commercially insignificant amount&lt;/strong&gt; and so the &lt;strong&gt;charterers were entitled to detain the vessel until the balance of the agreed cargo was loaded&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In contrast, once the loading operation has been completed, the &lt;strong&gt;charterer has no right to detain the vessel further&lt;/strong&gt;, even though the &lt;strong&gt;laytime has not expired&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Nolisement (Owners) v Bunge y Born the loading was completed some 19 days before the expiration of the lay days, but the charterers delayed a further three days before presenting bills of lading to the master since they were &lt;strong&gt;unable to decide on the port of discharge&lt;/strong&gt;. They were held &lt;strong&gt;liable for damages for two days’ detention&lt;/strong&gt;. It would seem a little inconsistent for the charterer to be penalized for &lt;strong&gt;detaining the vessel after the completion of loading&lt;/strong&gt; if he could retain complete freedom of action by withholding a minimal amount of cargo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, it must be noted that the loading stage is &lt;strong&gt;not complete&lt;/strong&gt; until the cargo is aboard the vessel and also stowed. Although stowage of the cargo is normally the responsibility of the shipowner and the cost is usually borne by him, it is nevertheless regarded as part of the loading operation and the charterer is under an obligation to bring the cargo alongside the vessel in sufficient time to enable the shipowner to complete the stowage within the lay days. With the completion of the loading operation, the end of the second stage of the voyage charter-party is reached and the risk of subsequent delay due to accidental hindrances and obstructions reverts to the shipowner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consequently, if &lt;strong&gt;after the cargo has been stowed the vessel&lt;/strong&gt; is prevented from embarking on the carrying voyage by reason of &lt;strong&gt;ice or bad weather&lt;/strong&gt;, the cost of the delay must be borne by the &lt;strong&gt;shipowner&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Damages for Ship Detention&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;damages-for-ship-detention&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#damages-for-ship-detention&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When there is &lt;strong&gt;no&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;provision&lt;/strong&gt; in the charterparty for the payment of demurrage, a charterer will be liable for damages for &lt;strong&gt;detention&lt;/strong&gt; for all the time he detains the vessel after the expiration of the lay days. In this situation damages are at large and will be assessed by the &lt;strong&gt;court&lt;/strong&gt; in relation to the actual loss suffered by the shipowner, and in accordance with the normal principles governing remoteness of damage in contract.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Damages for detention is also the appropriate remedy where a charter-party stipulates a fixed number of days for the &lt;strong&gt;payment of demurrage&lt;/strong&gt;, and those days have expired. In the latter case, however, the court will normally assess the damages at a figure corresponding to the &lt;strong&gt;agreed demurrage rate&lt;/strong&gt;, though it is open to either party to prove that such a rate &lt;strong&gt;does not&lt;/strong&gt; represent the actual loss suffered by the shipowner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A shipowner is &lt;strong&gt;not allowed to withdraw&lt;/strong&gt; his vessel during any period for which the payment of demurrage has been agreed, unless the delay is such as to &lt;strong&gt;frustrate the object of the charter-party&lt;/strong&gt;. On the other hand, once the &lt;strong&gt;specified demurrage period has expired&lt;/strong&gt; he is &lt;strong&gt;no longer obliged&lt;/strong&gt; to remain in port to complete the loading operation and to be restricted to a claim for damages for detention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If part of the cargo has been loaded, he may sail and claim compensation in the form of &lt;strong&gt;dead freight,&lt;/strong&gt; or, if the charterer has failed to ship any cargo, he may &lt;strong&gt;rescind the charter&lt;/strong&gt; and sue for &lt;strong&gt;damages&lt;/strong&gt; at large. If, however, the delay occurs at the discharging port, he has little option except to complete the unloading operation and claim damages for &lt;strong&gt;detention&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ship Detention in Dry Bulk Shipping&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;ship-detention-in-dry-bulk-shipping&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#ship-detention-in-dry-bulk-shipping&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Damages for ship detention refer to the financial compensation sought by a ship owner or charterer when a vessel is unduly delayed or detained by a third party, such as a port authority, shipper, or consignee. These damages are meant to cover the losses incurred as a result of the vessel being unavailable for other potential charters, increased operational expenses, or other associated costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the event of ship detention, the following steps can be taken to recover damages:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Identify the cause of detention:&lt;/strong&gt; Determine the reason for the delay or detention, such as port congestion, labor strikes, customs issues, or delays in cargo handling. Establish whether the detention was caused by a breach of contract, negligence, or another actionable reason.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Document the detention:&lt;/strong&gt; Keep a detailed record of the events, including the timeline of events, correspondence with the parties involved, and any other relevant documentation. This information will be crucial in supporting a claim for damages.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Calculate damages:&lt;/strong&gt; Determine the amount of damages incurred as a result of the detention. This may include the loss of income from potential charters, additional operational expenses, crew wages, and other associated costs. The calculation should be based on the daily rate specified in the charter party agreement or, in the absence of such an agreement, a reasonable market rate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Notify the responsible party:&lt;/strong&gt; Once the cause of detention and the damages have been identified, inform the responsible party of the situation and provide them with an opportunity to rectify the issue. Keep a record of this communication for future reference.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pursue legal action&lt;/strong&gt;: If the detention is not resolved and the responsible party is unwilling to compensate for the damages, consider seeking legal advice and pursuing a claim in court or through arbitration. Provide all relevant documentation and evidence to support your claim.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mitigate damages:&lt;/strong&gt; While pursuing damages, take steps to mitigate the impact of the detention. This may involve seeking alternative charters, reducing operational costs, or resolving the issue that caused the detention.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Damages for ship detention are meant to compensate the ship owner or charterer for losses incurred due to delays or detention caused by third parties. To recover these damages, it is essential to identify the cause of detention, document the events, calculate the damages, notify the responsible party, and pursue legal action if necessary. Additionally, taking steps to mitigate damages can help reduce the overall impact of the detention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How is Demurrage Calculated?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;Demurrage is a fee charged to the charterer by the shipowner for not loading or unloading the cargo within the agreed-upon laytime. Laytime is the time allocated for these processes, usually specified in the charter party (contract between the shipowner and charterer). Demurrage calculations can vary depending on the specific terms of the contract, but the general process involves the following steps:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Determine the Laytime:&lt;/strong&gt; Laytime is usually stated in hours or days in the charter party. It is the period during which the ship must be loaded and unloaded without incurring demurrage charges.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Calculate Used Laytime:&lt;/strong&gt; Calculate the actual time taken for loading and/or unloading. This may include weekends, holidays, and other exceptions as specified in the contract.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Identify Any Exceptions:&lt;/strong&gt; Identify any time periods excluded from the laytime calculation as per the contract terms, such as bad weather, customs delays, or equipment breakdowns. Subtract these periods from the used laytime to arrive at the adjusted laytime.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Compare Laytime and Adjusted Laytime:&lt;/strong&gt; If the adjusted laytime is less than or equal to the agreed-upon laytime, there is no demurrage. If the adjusted laytime exceeds the agreed-upon laytime, demurrage is incurred.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Calculate Demurrage:&lt;/strong&gt; To calculate demurrage, first determine the excess time by subtracting the agreed-upon laytime from the adjusted laytime. Then, multiply the excess time by the demurrage rate specified in the charter party. The demurrage rate is usually quoted in USD per day or per hour.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Demurrage Calculation Example 1&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;demurrage-calculation-example-1&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Agreed laytime: 5 days&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Actual laytime used: 7 days&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Weather-related delays: 1 day&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Demurrage rate: $15,000 per day&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adjusted laytime = Actual laytime used – Weather-related delays = 7 days – 1 day = 6 days&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the adjusted laytime (6 days) is greater than the agreed laytime (5 days), demurrage is incurred.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Excess time = Adjusted laytime – Agreed laytime = 6 days – 5 days = 1 day&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Demurrage = Excess time × Demurrage rate = 1 day × $13,000 per day = $13,000&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this example, the charterer would be required to pay $13,000 in demurrage charges to the shipowner.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;a href=&#34;#demurrage-calculation-example-2&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here is another example of Demurrage Calculation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assumptions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Agreed laytime: 10 days&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Actual laytime used: 14 days&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Non-working days (e.g., weekends, holidays): 2 days&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Customs-related delays: 1 day&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Demurrage rate: $15,000 per day&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Step 1: Calculate the adjusted laytime Adjusted laytime = Actual laytime used – Non-working days – Customs-related delays = 14 days – 2 days – 1 day = 11 days&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Step 2: Compare laytime and adjusted laytime In this case, the adjusted laytime (11 days) is greater than the agreed laytime (10 days), which means demurrage is incurred.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Step 3: Calculate demurrage Excess time = Adjusted laytime – Agreed laytime = 11 days – 10 days = 1 day&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Demurrage = Excess time × Demurrage rate = 1 day × $15,000 per day = $15,000&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this example, the charterer would be required to pay $15,000 in demurrage charges to the shipowner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Assumptions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Agreed laytime: 8 days&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Actual laytime used: 12 days&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Non-working days (e.g., weekends, holidays): 3 days&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mechanical breakdown delays: 1 day&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Demurrage rate: $12,000 per day&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Step 1: Calculate the adjusted laytime Adjusted laytime = Actual laytime used – Non-working days – Mechanical breakdown delays = 12 days – 3 days – 1 day = 8 days&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Step 2: Compare laytime and adjusted laytime In this case, the adjusted laytime (8 days) is equal to the agreed laytime (8 days), which means no demurrage is incurred.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Step 3: Calculate demurrage Since the adjusted laytime does not exceed the agreed laytime, there is no excess time, and therefore, no demurrage charges are applied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this example, the charterer would not be required to pay any demurrage charges to the shipowner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Non-working days (e.g., weekends, holidays): 2 days&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Weather-related delays: 1 day&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Demurrage rate: $8,000 per day&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Step 1: Calculate the adjusted laytime Adjusted laytime = Actual laytime used – Non-working days – Weather-related delays = 9 days – 2 days – 1 day = 6 days&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Step 2: Compare laytime and adjusted laytime In this case, the adjusted laytime (6 days) is equal to the agreed laytime (6 days), which means no demurrage is incurred.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Step 3: Calculate demurrage Since the adjusted laytime does not exceed the agreed laytime, there is no excess time, and therefore, no demurrage charges are applied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this example, the charterer would not be required to pay any demurrage charges to the shipowner.&lt;/p&gt;

Here are some tips to help avoid these charges:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Plan ahead:&lt;/strong&gt; Proper planning and coordination between all parties involved in the cargo handling process can help avoid delays. Make sure the cargo is ready for loading or unloading before the vessel arrives at the port.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Communicate effectively:&lt;/strong&gt; Regular communication with the port, vessel agents, and stevedores can help identify potential issues early, allowing for faster resolution and minimizing delays.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Choose reliable partners:&lt;/strong&gt; Work with reputable shipping lines, freight forwarders, and transport providers to ensure timely delivery and handling of cargo.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Monitor ship schedules:&lt;/strong&gt; Keep track of vessel schedules and be aware of any changes in arrival or departure times. This can help you adjust your plans and avoid demurrage charges.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Understand port requirements:&lt;/strong&gt; Familiarize yourself with port regulations, customs procedures, and documentation requirements to avoid delays caused by non-compliance or missing documents.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Allocate buffer time:&lt;/strong&gt; Allow some buffer time in your planning to accommodate unforeseen delays, such as weather-related disruptions or mechanical issues.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Opt for faster modes of transportation:&lt;/strong&gt; If your cargo is time-sensitive, consider using faster modes of transportation, such as air freight or express shipping services.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Negotiate longer laytime:&lt;/strong&gt; If you anticipate delays in loading or unloading cargo, negotiate a longer laytime with the carrier to provide some flexibility.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Use technology:&lt;/strong&gt; Utilize software and tools to track and manage your shipments more effectively, enabling better visibility and control over your supply chain.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Train your staff:&lt;/strong&gt; Ensure your team is well-trained in handling cargo and documentation to minimize errors that can cause delays.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By following these tips and maintaining open communication with all parties involved, you can reduce the likelihood of incurring demurrage charges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How much does Demurrage Cost in Dry Bulk Shipping?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;how-much-does-demurrage-cost-in-dry-bulk-shipping&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#how-much-does-demurrage-cost-in-dry-bulk-shipping&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cost of demurrage in dry bulk shipping varies based on several factors, including the type of vessel, the market conditions, the cargo being transported, and the specific terms agreed upon in the charter party contract. Demurrage fees are typically calculated on a per-day basis, referred to as a daily demurrage rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some factors that influence the cost of demurrage in dry bulk shipping include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vessel Size and Type:&lt;/strong&gt; The daily demurrage rate can vary depending on the size and type of the vessel, such as Handysize, Supramax, Panamax, or Capesize. Larger vessels usually have higher daily demurrage rates due to their higher operating costs and earning potential.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dry Bulk Shipping Market conditions:&lt;/strong&gt; The daily demurrage rate can be influenced by the supply and demand dynamics in the dry bulk shipping market. During periods of high demand or limited vessel availability, demurrage rates may be higher to reflect the opportunity cost of keeping the vessel idle.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bulk Cargo Type:&lt;/strong&gt; The type of cargo being transported can also impact the demurrage rate, as some cargo types may require specialized handling equipment or additional precautions that can influence the cost of delays.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Charter Party Agreement:&lt;/strong&gt; The demurrage rate, as well as the allowed laytime and free time, are typically negotiated and specified in the charter party agreement between the ship owner and the charterer. The demurrage rate may be influenced by the bargaining power of the parties involved and the specific terms of the agreement.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Geographic Location and Port Conditions:&lt;/strong&gt; Demurrage rates can also be influenced by the geographic location and port conditions, as certain ports may have higher operating costs or be more prone to congestion and delays.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is difficult to provide a specific cost for demurrage in dry bulk shipping, as it can vary widely depending on the factors mentioned above. However, daily demurrage rates can range from a few thousand dollars to tens of thousands of dollars per day, depending on the vessel size, market conditions, and other factors. It is essential for both ship owners and charterers to carefully review and negotiate the demurrage terms in their charter party agreements to minimize the risk of incurring unexpected demurrage costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who pays for Demurrage Charges in Dry Bulk Shipping?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;who-pays-for-demurrage-charges-in-dry-bulk-shipping&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#who-pays-for-demurrage-charges-in-dry-bulk-shipping&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In dry bulk shipping, demurrage charges are usually the responsibility of the &lt;strong&gt;charterer&lt;/strong&gt; or the party causing the delay. The specific terms and conditions regarding demurrage charges are outlined in the charter party agreement, which is a contract between the ship owner and the charterer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is a general overview of demurrage responsibilities in dry bulk shipping:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Charterer’s Responsibility:&lt;/strong&gt; In most cases, the charterer is responsible for paying demurrage charges, as they are typically the party organizing the loading and unloading of the cargo at the port. Delays in cargo handling that exceed the allowed laytime specified in the charter party agreement result in demurrage charges, which are then billed to the charterer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shipper or Consignee’s Responsibility:&lt;/strong&gt; In some cases, the responsibility for demurrage charges may be passed on from the charterer to the shipper or consignee if the delays are caused by their actions or negligence. This transfer of responsibility would be outlined in the contracts between the charterer and the shipper or consignee.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shipowner’s Responsibility:&lt;/strong&gt; If the ship owner or their representatives, such as the vessel’s crew or agent, cause delays that result in demurrage charges, the ship owner may be held responsible for those charges. However, this scenario is relatively rare, as demurrage charges are typically associated with cargo handling delays.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is crucial for all parties involved in dry bulk shipping to carefully review and understand the terms and conditions of their contracts, including the charter party agreement and any contracts between the charterer, shipper, and consignee. Clear communication and understanding of each party’s responsibilities can help minimize disputes and unexpected costs related to demurrage charges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is the Process of Demurrage in Dry Bulk Shipping?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;what-is-the-process-of-demurrage-in-dry-bulk-shipping&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#what-is-the-process-of-demurrage-in-dry-bulk-shipping&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The process of demurrage in dry bulk shipping involves several steps, from negotiating the terms in the charter party agreement to calculating and settling the demurrage charges in case of delays. Here’s an overview of the demurrage process in dry bulk shipping:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Negotiating terms in the charter party agreement&lt;/strong&gt;: The charter party agreement is a contract between the ship owner and the charterer that outlines the terms and conditions for the shipment of cargo. This agreement includes the laytime, which is the allowed time for loading and unloading the cargo, as well as the demurrage rate, which is the daily rate charged if the laytime is exceeded.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Notice of readiness (NOR):&lt;/strong&gt; Upon the vessel’s arrival at the port, the ship owner or their representative (usually the ship’s master or agent) issues a notice of readiness (NOR) to the charterer. This notice indicates that the vessel is ready to load or unload cargo. The charterer is then responsible for providing a berth for the vessel and commencing cargo operations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Commencement of Laytime:&lt;/strong&gt; Laytime begins once the vessel has arrived, the NOR has been issued and accepted, and any agreed-upon preconditions have been met. These preconditions may include customs clearance, safety inspections, or other requirements outlined in the charter party agreement.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Monitoring Laytime:&lt;/strong&gt; Throughout the loading and unloading process, the vessel’s agent, master, or other representatives will monitor the time used for cargo operations, ensuring that it does not exceed the allowed laytime.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Calculating Demurrage:&lt;/strong&gt; If the loading or unloading process takes longer than the allowed laytime, demurrage charges will begin to accrue. These charges are calculated using the demurrage rate specified in the charter party agreement, multiplied by the number of days (or part of a day) that the laytime is exceeded.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Settlement of Demurrage Charges:&lt;/strong&gt; Once the cargo operations are complete, and any demurrage charges have been calculated, an invoice for the charges will be issued by the ship owner to the charterer. The charterer is then responsible for paying the demurrage charges according to the terms of the charter party agreement.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By understanding the demurrage process in dry bulk shipping and following the steps outlined in the charter party agreement, all parties can minimize the risk of disputes and ensure smooth and efficient cargo operations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is a Demurrage Charge in Dry Bulk Shipping?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;what-is-a-demurrage-charge-in-dry-bulk-shipping&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#what-is-a-demurrage-charge-in-dry-bulk-shipping&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A demurrage charge in dry bulk shipping is a fee imposed on the charterer when the process of loading or unloading cargo at a port takes longer than the agreed-upon time, known as laytime. Demurrage charges are meant to compensate the ship owner for the additional time the vessel is kept idle at the port, as delays can lead to increased operational costs and the loss of income from potential charters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Demurrage charges are calculated based on a daily rate, which is specified in the charter party agreement between the ship owner and the charterer. Typically, the demurrage charges start accruing after a “free time” period, also known as laytime, has been exceeded. This laytime is a grace period provided by the carrier for loading or unloading the cargo without incurring additional charges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In dry bulk shipping, demurrage charges are associated with the vessel itself rather than specific cargo or containers, as dry bulk cargo is typically loaded and unloaded directly onto or from the vessel using specialized equipment. By minimizing delays in cargo handling and adhering to the laytime agreed upon in the charter party agreement, the charterer can avoid or reduce demurrage charges in dry bulk shipping.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is Despatch equals to Half Demurrage (HD) in Ship Chartering?  (D=HD)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;what-is-despatch-equals-to-half-demurrage-hd-in-ship-chartering-dhd&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#what-is-despatch-equals-to-half-demurrage-hd-in-ship-chartering-dhd&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despatch equal to Half Demurrage (HD) in ship chartering is a clause that can be included in the charter party agreement between the ship owner and the charterer. It specifies that if the loading or unloading process is completed in less time than the agreed-upon laytime, the ship owner will reward the charterer with a financial incentive called despatch. In this particular clause, the despatch rate is set at half the rate of the demurrage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The purpose of including a “Despatch equals to Half Demurrage” clause in the charter party agreement is to encourage the charterer to expedite cargo handling operations, which in turn benefits the ship owner by allowing the vessel to depart earlier and be available for other potential charters. This helps improve the overall efficiency of the shipping process and can lead to cost savings for both parties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To calculate despatch under the HD clause, the following steps are taken:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Determine the actual time used for loading or unloading, and compare it to the allowed laytime in the charter party agreement.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Calculate the time saved by subtracting the actual time used from the allowed laytime.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Apply the “Half Demurrage” rate to the time saved by multiplying the saved time by half the demurrage rate specified in the agreement.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The resulting amount is the despatch payable by the ship owner to the charterer as a reward for completing the cargo handling process faster than the agreed-upon laytime.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By including a “Despatch equals to Half Demurrage” clause in the charter party agreement, both the ship owner and the charterer can benefit from increased efficiency in the loading and unloading process.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Charter party disputes</title>
      <link>https://www.anirbanmarine.in/docs/partc/em303/cshipmgmt/chrtrdispute/</link>

        &lt;p&gt;Charter party disputes are disagreements between charterers and shipowners over the terms of a charter party. Charter parties are complex legal documents, and it is not uncommon for disputes to arise over their interpretation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the most common charter party disputes include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Freight rate disputes:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Freight rate disputes arise when the charterer and shipowner disagree on the freight rate that is payable under the charter party. This can happen for a variety of reasons, such as a change in market conditions, a dispute over the quantity of cargo transported, or a disagreement over the distance traveled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Laytime disputes:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Laytime disputes arise when the charterer and shipowner disagree on the amount of time that the charterer has to load and discharge the cargo. This can happen for a variety of reasons, such as port congestion, bad weather, or a dispute over the condition of the cargo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Demurrage and despatch disputes:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Demurrage disputes arise when the charterer exceeds the laytime. Despatch disputes arise when the charterer saves time on the laytime. Disputes over demurrage and despatch can arise for a variety of reasons, such as a disagreement over the calculation of laytime, or a dispute over whether the charterer is responsible for demurrage or entitled to despatch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Loading and discharging disputes:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Loading and discharging disputes arise when the charterer and shipowner disagree on the quality of the cargo loaded or discharged, or the timeliness of the loading or discharging process. These disputes can arise for a variety of reasons, such as damage to the cargo, delays in loading or discharging, or a dispute over the charterer&amp;rsquo;s responsibility to load and discharge the cargo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Havarie disputes:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Havarie disputes arise when the charterer and shipowner disagree on who is responsible for losses caused by events such as storms, groundings, or collisions. Havarie disputes can be complex and can involve a variety of legal issues, such as the law of general average, the law of salvage, and the law of marine insurance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Charter party disputes can have a significant financial impact on both charterers and shipowners. In some cases, charter party disputes can lead to the termination of the charter party and the loss of the cargo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Resolving charter party disputes&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;resolving-charter-party-disputes&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#resolving-charter-party-disputes&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Charter party disputes can be resolved through negotiation, mediation, or arbitration. Negotiation is the preferred method of dispute resolution, as it allows the parties to reach a mutually agreeable solution. Mediation is a process in which a neutral third party helps the parties to reach a settlement. Arbitration is a process in which a neutral third party hears evidence from both sides and makes a binding decision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a charter party dispute cannot be resolved through negotiation, mediation, or arbitration, it may be necessary to file a lawsuit in court. However, this should be a last resort, as it is expensive and time-consuming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Tips for avoiding charter party disputes&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;tips-for-avoiding-charter-party-disputes&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#tips-for-avoiding-charter-party-disputes&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are a number of things that charterers and shipowners can do to avoid charter party disputes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Negotiate the charter party carefully:&lt;/strong&gt; Before signing a charter party, it is important to carefully negotiate all of the terms of the contract. This includes the freight rate, laytime, demurrage and despatch provisions, loading and discharging obligations, and havarie clauses.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Get everything in writing:&lt;/strong&gt; All agreements between the charterer and shipowner should be in writing and signed by both parties. This includes any amendments or modifications to the charter party.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Be clear about your expectations:&lt;/strong&gt; Both the charterer and shipowner should clearly communicate their expectations to each other in writing. This includes expectations regarding the loading and discharging process, the condition of the cargo, and the performance of the charter party.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Monitor the charter party performance:&lt;/strong&gt; Both the charterer and shipowner should monitor the performance of the charter party and take action if there are any problems. This includes monitoring the loading and discharging process, the condition of the cargo, and the overall performance of the vessel.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Charter party disputes can be complex and costly. However, there are a number of things that charterers and shipowners can do to avoid disputes and resolve them quickly and efficiently if they do arise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chartering Disputes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;There will inevitably be disagreements between Shipowners and Charterers from time to time, although most discrepancies will be resolved amicably and with a minimum of trouble and cost. A few conflicts may cause much more difficulties. These difficulties may be that outsiders well versed in commercial law will need to be contacted in to provide independent settlement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In such circumstances, it is crucial to establish the legal code that will apply, since laws vary from country to country, and different judgments might be reached on the identical set of cases depending on the jurisdiction that is to apply. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The place of residence of the Contracting Parties (Shipowners and Charterers), the place where the Contract (Charterparty) was created, or specific reference to a particular **Place **or **Applicable Law **may each have a bearing on where a disagreement should be evaluated, discussed, and settled. Therefore, Charterparty or other shipping contracts should stipulate the legal code that is applicable for the reference of any conflicts that may arise, for example, English Law to apply. Furthermore, Charterparty or other shipping contracts should stipulate, the format of any legal hearing. In other words, Charterparty or other shipping contracts should define whether conflicts are to be referred to Court or Maritime Arbitration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Global shipping is conducted in the English language. In England, a wide-ranging and adaptable commercial legal code has evolved. Many Shipowners and Charterers prefer English law in times of conflict. Therefore, it is common to encounter, for instance, a Greek Shipowner and an American Charterer resolving a dry cargo Charterparty dispute before a London Arbitration based on English law. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are important arbitration centers in New York (The Society of Marine Arbitrators) and Paris (Arbitration Facilities of the International Chamber of Commerce). However, by far the immense number of shipping disagreements are conducted in London under the terms of English law. Consequently, considerable Protection and Indemnity Clubs (P&amp;amp;I) Clubs were established in London. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;London Maritime Arbitrators Association (LMAA), and a considerable number of lawyers that are specializing in shipping disputes are based in London. Therefore, shipping companies from the world over look to London and English law for guidance on the drafting of shipping contracts and for settling disagreements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;VOYLAY Rules&lt;/strong&gt; and **Time Charter Interpretation Code 2000 **have been drafted to assist interpret some of the more common causes of disputes under Charterparty Forms. &lt;strong&gt;VOYLAY Rules&lt;/strong&gt; help in cutting through the confusion that covers the perennial problem of Laytime Calculation. &lt;strong&gt;Time Charter Interpretation Code 2000 (FONASBA)&lt;/strong&gt; removes the mystery of some common areas of conflict in Time Charters. Unlike the Voylay Rules, Time Charter Interpretation Code 2000 does not concern itself with one topic but covers several different scopes. &lt;strong&gt;VOYLAY Rules&lt;/strong&gt; and **Time Charter Interpretation Code 2000 **are at the bottom of the page. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;English Courts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;english-courts&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#english-courts&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;A shipping dispute that is to be resolved in the English Courts would be referred to a judge in the Commercial Court in the first instance, the Commercial Court being part of the Queen’s Bench Division of the High Court, in London. Usually, the dispute will end with judgment at that stage, although it may be possible to appeal against the verdict to the decision of a panel of judges sitting in the Court of Appeal and, similarly, against their judgment, to the highest Court in England, the House of Lords. Appealing is pricey and likely to be time-consuming, nevertheless, as a consequence of which, most parties selecting English law to opt-in their contract for any disputes to be referred to Maritime Arbitration in London.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Maritime Arbitration&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;maritime-arbitration&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#maritime-arbitration&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most diligent London-based Maritime Arbitrators are full members of the &lt;strong&gt;London Maritime Arbitrators Association (LMAA)&lt;/strong&gt;. London Maritime Arbitrators Association (LMAA) is an association in London. Maritime Arbitrators’ backgrounds are remarkably diverse. London Maritime Arbitrators Association’s (LMAA) members publish around 500 Arbitration Awards per year. London Maritime Arbitrators Association’s (LMAA) members are receiving around 4,000 appointments per year, presumably more than all other Maritime Arbitration Centers added together. Maritime Arbitration disputes cover a broad range of subjects, including Charterparty, Bill of Lading (B/L), Sale and Purchase (S&amp;amp;P), Ship Operation, Cargo Trading, and Shipbuilding contracts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In some jurisdictions, Maritime Arbitrators may in effect be able substantially to disregard any system of law. On the other hand, London Maritime Arbitrators Association (LMAA) members and other English arbitrators are bound to and consistently apply English commercial and maritime law. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, English commercial and maritime law are so highly developed as to be widely regarded and applied as if it were the international law of commerce and shipping. English commercial and maritime law continues to develop to meet changing needs mainly due to the possibility of appealing decisions Arbitration Awards, especially in cases where the commercial public interest is involved. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the English Arbitration Act (1950), as amended by the Arbitration Act (1979), appeals are restricted, but those that are granted are heard in the Commercial Court whose judges have great experience in commercial and maritime arbitration, a factor that often facilitates equitable compromise in disputes of this nature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Originally, arbitration was designed as a distinctly non-legal way of solving disputes and the arbitrators preferred and selected were men with a commercial background rather than with legal qualifications. It was believed that men with a commercial background would lend a fairer and less straight-laced mind to the disagreements on hand and interpret the provisions of the applicable Charterparty Forms or other commercial agreements without being strictly concerned with the legal niceties and sheer accuracy or non-accuracy of the terminology used in the Charterparty Forms’ wording. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Centrocon Arbitration Clause stipulates the appointment of men engaged in the shipping and/or grain trades and who are members of the Baltic Exchange. However, over the years, the procedure of arbitration has gradually assumed a legal flavor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a Charterparty Form stipulates for each party (Shipowners and Charterers) to appoint their arbitrator, if contracting parties (Shipowners and Charterers) are unable to agree an umpire be mutually nominated, it might be assumed that there is a tendency toward the arbitrators being advocates for their appointers. Nevertheless, this is a misconceived idea since an arbitrator is a private judge ruling impartially between the contracting parties (Shipowners and Charterers) whether sitting as sole arbitrator or a member of a larger tribunal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The concept of arbitration must not be underestimated. Originally, arbitration may have been intended to have a non-legal flavor. Arbitration must retain something of the judicial since arbitration is after all an alternative. Arbitration might be the only alternative in the lack of an amicable resolution between the contracting parties themselves, to court proceedings. Although the agreement to arbitrate any dispute may originally be an oral agreement between the contracting parties (Shipowners and Charterers), it is advisable for the arbitration agreement to be included in writing either as an express clause in the Charterparty Form though it is unlikely that a court of law would grant a stay of proceedings in favor of arbitration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generally, Arbitration Clauses incorporate a Time Limit within which appointments of arbitrators should be made and the leading case of Ion (1971) provides a court ruling as to what happens when an Arbitration Clause provision of three (3) months Time Limit (Centrocon) conflicts with the twelve (12) months (Clause Paramount – Hague Rules) provisions which applied to the same Charterparty Form. The Hague Rules time limitation period prevailed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arbitration Clause in a Charterparty Form can be binding upon the innocent holder of a Bill of Lading (B/L) issued under a Charterparty Form is dependent totally upon the incorporating words in the Bill of Lading (B/L), which, if sufficiently comprehensive, could entitle a Shipowner or Carrier to compel a Bill of Lading (B/L) Holder to arbitration under an Arbitration Agreement or vice versa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arbitration Agreement to be binding and to have the protection afforded by the United Kingdom’s Arbitration Acts (1950-1979), must be in writing and should be explicit in arbitration terms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An Arbitration Agreement must be precise, unambiguous, and clear in its terms and wording. Therefore, an Arbitration Clause with wording such as “Arbitration, if any, to be held in New York” is not a binding agreement to arbitrate. It merely agrees to arbitrate in a certain stipulated place if there is an agreement to arbitrate at all is a significantly different thing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The UK Arbitration Act defines an Arbitration Agreement as a “written agreement to submit present or future differences to arbitration, whether an arbitrator is named or not”. How broad in scope the agreement to arbitrate is, depends again on the actual wording of the clause. If Arbitration Clause incorporates such words as “all matters in difference” the scope is remarkably comprehensive, however, the more typically used wording in Maritime Contracts (Charterparty Forms) is “disputes arising out of the contract” would by its face value sense exclude a dispute as to whether the contract was ever entered into in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The inclusion of an Arbitration Clause in a Charterparty Form does not automatically exclude the jurisdiction of a Court of Law to try disputes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite being a party to an Arbitration Agreement, an aggrieved party in Maritime Contracts (Charterparty Forms) is not barred from taking legal action through the law. Courts have discretionary power to decide whether Courts will stay proceedings in favor of arbitration or whether Courts will try the issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if the Court stays proceedings in favor of arbitration, Court intervention may become inevitable as a means of enforcing any Arbitration Award that may eventually be made, or to set aside an Arbitration Award when there may have been misconduct of an arbitrator or the Arbitration Award has been for some reason improperly secured, or simply there has been an &lt;strong&gt;Error on the Face of the Arbitration Award&lt;/strong&gt;. To elaborate on this last phrase an error of law on the face of the Arbitration Award has been described as some legal proposition contained in the Arbitration Award, or documents incorporated into the Arbitration Award, which is the basis of the Arbitration Award and which can be said to be erroneous. Nevertheless, the error must appear on the face of the Arbitration Award otherwise the Courts have no discretionary power to set it aside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who may be appointed as a Maritime Arbitrator?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;who-may-be-appointed-as-a-maritime-arbitrator&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#who-may-be-appointed-as-a-maritime-arbitrator&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Undoubtedly, not a madman, an idiot, an infant, or an outlaw can be appointed as Maritime Arbitrator. These are well-identified disabilities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A competent arbitrator is an individual of sufficient skill in the arbitration under disagreement and is not restricted legally or naturally from giving proper judgment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The type of individuals may be limited and specified as clearly it is in the Centrocon Arbitration Clause where the idea is to appoint individuals versed in the shipping and/or grain trades. It is essential that an arbitrator must be impartial and have no bias, interest, or leaning towards one or the other party. This is a ground for disqualification. Furthermore, if an arbitrator becomes a witness in the arbitration, this is also the ground for disqualification.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The procedure to be followed in &lt;strong&gt;Arbitration Proceedings&lt;/strong&gt; in Chronological Order:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1- Arbitrators must be appointed by the contracting parties to the dispute and accept the appointment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2- Arbitrators may wish to meet with the contracting parties to the dispute informally before an official hearing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3- The case goes to a hearing, the time and place being the choice of the arbitrators unless otherwise specified. Alternatively, if the contracting parties prefer, the case may be resolved on Documents Alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each contracting party’s lawyer may be present at the official hearing, at their option, provided sufficient notice is given to the opposing party. All evidence must be completely heard and the arbitrators have the absolute right to decide whether evidence is admissible or not. Great care should be exercised since the wrong admission of evidence could be such a fundamental mistake as to lead eventually to the setting aside of the Arbitration Award. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the conclusion of the official hearing, the arbitrators must prepare the &lt;strong&gt;Arbitration Award&lt;/strong&gt; which is the document incorporating the &lt;strong&gt;Arbitrators’ Decision&lt;/strong&gt;. The Arbitration Award is final and for this reason must be clear, unambiguous, and decisive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The referring of a dispute to arbitrators is known as the &lt;strong&gt;Reference&lt;/strong&gt;. A distinction should be made between the costs of the Reference and the costs of the Arbitration Award. These costs are at the discretion of the arbitrators. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The costs of the Reference&lt;/strong&gt; include all those general and special expenses incurred in the course of inquiries either by the contracting parties or by their legal advisers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The costs of the Arbitration Award&lt;/strong&gt; are the remuneration and expenses due to the arbitrator and which he has a right to demand as a condition precedent to his delivering his Arbitration Award. The party which is unsuccessful bears all the costs. Nevertheless, the arbitrator may, at his discretion change this and may, for instance, direct that each party bears his costs. In other words, each party pays the costs of the Reference and half the costs of the Arbitration Award.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ArbitrationAct (1979) abolished the Case Stated procedure originally introduced by ArbitrationAct (1950). Furthermore, ArbitrationAct (1979) removed the right to have an Arbitration Award set aside because of an Error of Fact or Law on the face of the Arbitration Award. This was a long-standing right under the Common Law. It was due to the strength of this right that Maritime Arbitrators have traditionally given the Reasons for Arbitration Award in a separate document for the information of the contracting parties, not to be considered as an official part of the Arbitration Award itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ArbitrationAct (1979) introduced a new procedure of Appeal exclusively concerned with an Error in Law. To some extent also there is still limited latitude given to an Arbitrator or either of the parties, if, during the arbitration proceeding a challenging question of law arises, to apply to the High Court for an answer. Nevertheless, the question must be of real importance substantially affecting the rights of one or both parties and one which might potentially mean substantial savings on the parties’ costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the ArbitrationAct (1979) first became effective, it was assumed that an appeal from an Arbitration Award would be the exception rather than the rule but it soon became clear that it was the other way round. In arbitration cases, losing parties rushed to appeal. The consequence of this was that it has now become hard to get leave to appeal. The preponderance of applications has been turned down. Therefore, it is crucial to regard the Arbitrators as the final arbiters, especially so if the contracting parties jointly expressed their wishes to that effect in the wording of the Arbitration Agreement, unless the results were so clearly wrong that, in the interests of justice they have to be corrected. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a judge to reverse the decision of an Arbitrator on purely technical points of little significance to the real issues, was not what the drafters of the legislation had in mind. One approach proposed was that if, for instance, the Charterparty Clause in dispute was a one-off contract that was unlikely to arise again, leave to appeal should be denied unless the Arbitrator was so obviously wrong in his decision that it would be inequitable not to disturb Arbitrator’s Arbitration Award.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One section of the ArbitrationAct (1950) which has remained unaffected by the ArbitrationAct (1979), authorizes relief in particular circumstances when one contracting party has strictly raised against the other the Time Bar, due to the failure by the other party to appoint the arbitrator within the time allowed. Possibly, this is a feature of what Lord Denning indicated when he said the law was about justice and not strictness. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If to stand firm on the Time Bar would cause the other party undue hardship, then the Court is empowered to extend the time at its discretion. The Time Bar cannot be applied absolutely and strictly if to do so would result in undue hardship, whether the time bar itself is regarded as completely extinguishing the claim or as simply barring the remedy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;**Arbitration Award Interest **&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;arbitration-award-interest&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#arbitration-award-interest&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Arbitrators are cloaked with the same authority as any commercial judges and are given ample discretion, provided that it is just and equitable to do so. Interest is in effect compensation for an individual who is being kept from his money. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What should be the Arbitration Award Interest Rate? Should Arbitration Award Interest Rate be the lending or the borrowing rate? In other words, should the party be remunerated because he has had to borrow money to meet a commitment that he would not have had to borrow had he been timely paid the capital sum due to him or because he has been deprived of the opportunity to timely invest the capital sum due to him and thus earn interest?. In the Wallersteiner v Moir case (1975), a reasonable rate of interest should be the minimum lending rate plus 1% to arrive at a reasonable borrowing rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Tehno Impex case (1981), the Arbitrator’s discretionary power concerning Arbitration Award Interest includes even situations where the principal sum has been paid before or after the arbitration has been started or before or after the Arbitration Award has been made. Therefore, it seems that Arbitrators have the power to Arbitration Award Interest where, for example, the respondent has paid up only at the eleventh hour before the Arbitration Award was made. Any doubt as to the correct rate of Arbitration Award Interest should be resolved in the light of any aspects relevant to the currency in which the Arbitration Award itself is made. Furthermore, Arbitrators are more qualified than judges to Arbitration Award Interest since Arbitrators are commercially minded people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The processes and practices for &lt;strong&gt;Maritime Arbitration&lt;/strong&gt; in London have become positively developed and have been codified into the &lt;strong&gt;London Maritime Arbitrators Association (LMAA) Terms&lt;/strong&gt;. Especially, London Maritime Arbitrators Association (LMAA) Terms (1987) boost speed and early hearings, the power of Maritime Arbitrators to order the provision of security for costs, and to order rectification of a contract in certain cases. Furthermore, there is now a codified Small Claims Procedure to simplify smaller cases. Small Claims Procedure limits costs to a fixed, mediocre sum, whilst **Conciliation **and **Mediation **procedures are also possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;London Maritime Arbitrators Association (LMAA) recommends a particular Arbitration Clause for insertion into Maritime Contracts (Charterparty Forms). London Maritime Arbitrators Association (LMAA) recommended Arbitration Clause is at the bottom of the page. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;London Maritime Arbitrators Association (LMAA)&lt;/strong&gt; recommended &lt;strong&gt;Arbitration Clause&lt;/strong&gt; does not refer to the &lt;strong&gt;Small Claims Procedure&lt;/strong&gt;. However, contracting parties are not prevented from editing the Arbitration Clause. For example, “all disputes up to a value of $100,000 are to be dealt with under the terms and conditions of the &lt;strong&gt;London Maritime Arbitrators Association (LMAA)****Small Claims Procedure (1989)&lt;/strong&gt;“. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Protection and Indemnity Clubs (P&amp;amp;I Clubs)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;protection-and-indemnity-clubs-pi-clubs&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#protection-and-indemnity-clubs-pi-clubs&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are several types of Protection and Indemnity Clubs (P&amp;amp;I Clubs), although by far the biggest and financially strongest sector is Shipowners’ Protection and Indemnity Clubs (P&amp;amp;I Clubs). Shipowners’ Protection and Indemnity Clubs (P&amp;amp;I Clubs) are mutual and non-profit making organizations that deliver &lt;strong&gt;Insurance Cover&lt;/strong&gt; for Shipowners and Ship Operators which is complementary to the insurance cover placed on the insurance market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no exact dividing line between the insurance cover afforded by insurance companies and that provided by Protection and Indemnity Clubs (P&amp;amp;I Clubs).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Traditionally, Protection and Indemnity Clubs (P&amp;amp;I Clubs) provide one-quarter (1/4) of a Shipowner’s collision insurance liability. Generally, Lloyds underwriters and insurance companies insure ships and cargoes, whilst Shipowners’ Protection and Indemnity Clubs (P&amp;amp;I Clubs) insure Shipowners’ liabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two of the factors which contributed to the formation of Shipowners’ Protection and Indemnity Clubs (P&amp;amp;I Clubs):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1- Extra risks that Shipowners had to bear following the acceptance of the Hague Rules&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2- Unwillingness of insurance underwriters to accept more than three-quarters (3/4) of Shipowners’ liability for damage done to another ship in a collision&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consequently, Shipowners associated together on a mutual basis, forming the directing boards of the Protection and Indemnity Clubs (P&amp;amp;I Clubs), whose administrators are mainly professional legal partnerships with legal experience. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Protection and Indemnity Clubs (P&amp;amp;I Clubs) Calls (Subscriptions)&lt;/strong&gt; are paid yearly based on the tonnage entered and on the record of the Shipowner concerned. A high claims record should mean that the **Calls (Subscriptions) **will be levied at a higher rate than for an entered Shipowner with a low claims record. If forecasted claims are higher than expected, &lt;strong&gt;Supplementary****Calls (Subscriptions)&lt;/strong&gt; will require to be levied to enable the Protection and Indemnity Clubs (P&amp;amp;I Clubs) to pay their way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Protection and Indemnity Clubs’ (P&amp;amp;I Clubs) &lt;strong&gt;Protection&lt;/strong&gt; feature would deal with issues such as: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One-quarter (1//4) of the Shipowner’s collision liability&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Personal Injury&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Crew Liabilities&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Damage to Piers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Removal of Wrecks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Protection and Indemnity Clubs’ (P&amp;amp;I Clubs) **Indemnity **feature would deal with issues such as: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Loss of or Damage to Cargo&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The proportion of General Average (GA)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Customs’ Fines&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, Protection and Indemnity Clubs (P&amp;amp;I Clubs) protect &lt;strong&gt;Freight, Demurrage, and Defence&lt;/strong&gt;. This would be concerned with the enforcement of legal proceedings for collection of freight and hire; conduct of actions and arbitrations, and general legal advice to Club Members.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Charterers Protection and Indemnity Clubs (P&amp;amp;I Clubs)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;charterers-protection-and-indemnity-clubs-pi-clubs&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#charterers-protection-and-indemnity-clubs-pi-clubs&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some Protection and Indemnity Clubs (P&amp;amp;I Clubs) seek to attract Ship Charterers and Ship Operators as members. On the other hand, specialized &lt;strong&gt;Charterers Protection and Indemnity Clubs (P&amp;amp;I Clubs)&lt;/strong&gt; exist to provide a scope of services for Charterers such as Defence Cover and Liability Cover.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;**Defense Cover: **for costs and expenses incurred in asserting or defending court actions or arbitrations &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Liability Cover:&lt;/strong&gt; indemnity for liabilities towards Shipowners, Disponent Shipowners, and Cargo Owners under Voyage and Time Charterparties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Professional Indemnity Insurance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;professional-indemnity-insurance&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#professional-indemnity-insurance&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Professional Indemnity Insurance is a third club type that exists for the benefit of **Shipbrokers **and &lt;strong&gt;Ship Agents&lt;/strong&gt;. Professional Indemnity Insurance provides services for members acting in the exercise of their profession as agents in Chartering, S&amp;amp;P (Sale and Purchase) of ships, Port Agency, Freight Forwarding (FF), Liner Agency, Travel Agency, Air Booking, Bunker Broking, and Ship Management companies. Professional Indemnity Insurance is available from  &lt;strong&gt;ITIC (International Transport Intermediaries Club)&lt;/strong&gt;. ITIC (International Transport Intermediaries Club) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;is based in London. ITIC (International Transport Intermediaries Club) was established by the merger of the TIM (Transport Intermediaries Mutual) and CISBA (Chartered and International Ship Brokers and Agents Club).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Professional Indemnity Insurance Cover is developed to assist in the recovery of Brokerages and Port Disbursements (PD). Professional Indemnity Insurance Cover indemnifies members against errors, omissions, and negligence, including breach of warranty of authority. Similar insurance cover may be obtained on the Lloyds Market and from a few insurance companies. It is mandatory for members of the Baltic Exchange and for company members of the Institute of Chartered Shipbrokers (ICS) to have satisfactory Professional Indemnity Insurance Cover.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unkonwn Charterers and Unkonwn Ship Operators&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;unkonwn-charterers-and-unkonwn-ship-operators&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#unkonwn-charterers-and-unkonwn-ship-operators&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The preponderance of Charterers, Ship Operators, Shipowners, Shipbrokers, and Ship Agents are honest and decent. The functioning of shipping markets depends to a significant extent upon mutual trust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unscrupulous Shipowners, Ship Operators, Charterers, or Traders may have the chance to exploit the trust of other shipping market players. Therefore, Shipowners encountering previously unknown charterers and charterers uncertain about the credentials of a new shipowner must investigate the other party’s backgrounds from BIMCO (Baltic and International Maritime Council), Baltic Exchange, or the International Maritime Bureau (IMB), and Shipping Market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Professionalism in Shipping Market&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;professionalism-in-shipping-market&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#professionalism-in-shipping-market&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Shipping Market, Shipbrokers should learn from experience to arm themselves with knowledge, at the same time Shipbrokers should gain a reputation for integrity. If all this can be associated, Shipbrokers should obtain a professional qualification, such as that offered by the Institute of Chartered Shipbrokers (ICS) in London. Shipbrokers should analyze and make a plan to achieve these goals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shipbrokers must acquire knowledge, not only of day-to-day shipping market events but also of more basic data. Shipbrokers should be members of various bodies, either individually or as an employee of a corporate entity. Shipping Market Organizations involved in dry-cargo shipping incorporate: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1- Institute of Chartered Shipbrokers (ICS):&lt;/strong&gt; offers both individual and corporate memberships. Individual members pass through examination and leading to fellowship status which qualifies the individual to be termed a Chartered Shipbroker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2- Baltic International Maritime Council (BIMCO):&lt;/strong&gt; open to shipping companies. Baltic International Maritime Council (BIMCO) provides valuable expertise and facilities to the international shipping community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3- The Baltic Exchange:&lt;/strong&gt; The Baltic Exchange is a membership organization for the maritime industry, and freight market information provider for the trading and settlement of physical and derivative contracts. Today, The Baltic Exchange is open to associates who do not necessarily attend daily and who may be residents outside the United Kingdom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;**4- International Maritime Bureau (IMB):  **International Maritime Bureau (IMB) is a specialized department of the International Chamber of Commerce. International Maritime Bureau’s (IMB) primary duty is to protect the integrity of international trade by seeking out fraud and malpractice. International Maritime Bureau (IMB) fights crimes related to maritime trade and transportation, especially piracy and commercial fraud, and in protecting the crew members of ships. International Maritime Bureau (IMB) is one of the shipping police forces to protect its members.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;**5- Protection and Indemnity Clubs (P&amp;amp;I Clubs): **are independent, not-for-profit mutual insurance associations, providing cover for its shipowner and charterer members against third-party liabilities arising out of the use and operation of vessels. Each Protection and Indemnity Club (P&amp;amp;I Club) is owned by its shipowner and charterer members. Protection and Indemnity Clubs’ (P&amp;amp;I Clubs’) operations and activities are overseen by a BOD (Board of Directors), or committee, elected from the membership. The day-to-day operations of theProtection and Indemnity Clubs (P&amp;amp;I Clubs) are conducted by experienced directors who are appointed by and report to their Club board.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6- Professional Indemnity Clubs:&lt;/strong&gt; Professional Indemnity Clubs are becoming more and more important for such as Shipbrokers and Ship Managers. ITIC (International Transport Intermediaries Club) is the leading provider of professional indemnity insurance to the marine sector. Globally, ITIC (International Transport Intermediaries Club) provides professional indemnity insurance for the world’s major shipbroking companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, Shipbrokers should read as much as possible. Besides reading shipping newspapers such as Tradewinds, and Lloyd’s List, Shipbrokers should read industrial and international news to be prepared for its impact on the shipping world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shipbrokers should build up a library of Chartering Books that are directly relevant to Shipbrokers’ business activities. Shipbrokers should always keep alert for new books or new editions of existing Chartering Books. Furthermore, Shipbrokers should follow up HandyBulk Chartering Lessons. (&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.handybulk.com/chartering-lessons&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;www.handybulk.com/chartering-lessons&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the Shipping Organizations listed above, such as the Baltic International Maritime Council (BIMCO), publish regular magazines as part of their membership whilst others, such as Lloyd’s of London Press, publish reports on maritime matters such as current law cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In daily trading and particularly in the drafting of Charterparty Forms, Shipbrokers should have a Charterparty Library. Charterparty may help Shipbrokers, however, there is little substitute for experience and for having the ability to incorporate what has been learned from knowledge, experience, and wide-reading into adapted Charterparty Clauses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually, Shipbrokers should work and practice in an efficient, encouraging office environment which brings us to the critical subject of Shipbrokers’ Office Organization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shipbrokers’ Office Organization&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;shipbrokers-office-organization&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#shipbrokers-office-organization&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are some Shipbrokers’ Offices with low overheads which regularly produce a high income and turnover with limited Chartering Team Members. On the other hand, there are over-employed Shipbrokers’ Offices, which perform poorly. It is not that employees in either group work significantly harder than in the other, although personal motivation is an important factor. The major difference comes down to Shipbrokers’ Office Organization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the dry-cargo market, Shipowners, Charterers, Traders, Ship Operators, Shipbrokers, and Ship Agents may require different organization types. Accordingly, it is challenging here to do more than to generalize, except to note that with computerization, many of the labor and time-demanding duties can now be tackled far more effectively. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In** Shipowners’ Office Organization**, office employee numbers can be related to the number of ships at sea to evaluate whether or not office management is being kept to reasonable proportions. Apparently, with a small fleet of ships, office employees per ship will likely be at a higher ratio than is required for a bigger fleet. With a large fleet, effective management from the top of the organization may be weakened unless uncompromising reporting methods are laid down and adhered to. One way of exercising effective management is to create teams of supervisors operating separate fleets within the whole, thereby doing away with departmentalization that would otherwise be required and which tends to create unnecessary rivalries, rather than to build up a more healthy, competition amongst internal fleets, which is to be encouraged. Whether departmentalized or divided into fleet units, the activities require a range of ship-management duties, such as operations, chartering, port captaincy, technical, insurance, storing and provisioning, and accountancy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;strong&gt;Shipbrokers’ Office Organization&lt;/strong&gt;, the size of the office depends on the number of clients that Shipbrokers serve. The more clients, the more Shipbrokers. The more Shipbrokers, the more backup employees such as those engaged in Post-Fixture and Accounting positions. Essentially, computers have eliminated secretarial assistance in the more technically advanced Shipbrokers’ Offices. However, there are still two (2) major areas of difficulty tending to prevent a truly thorough computerized system in Shipbrokers’ Office Organizations. The first is the hardship of preparing Charterparty Forms, almost all Charterparty Forms are based on an old-fashioned printed text that is repeatedly amended during Chartering Negotiations, calling for accuracy of precise deletions and insertions when drafting Charterparty Forms. Secondly, &lt;strong&gt;Junior Shipbrokers&lt;/strong&gt; are still employed for feeding computers with the data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In some cases, Shipowners prefer to conceal from the general market the availability of some or all of their ships, or more efficient Shipbrokers prefer to work on an exclusive basis. The last thing that any Shipbroker wants is for Charterers and Shipowners to communicate directly, as this will diminish the need for Shipbroking Services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;strong&gt;Charterer’s Office****Organization&lt;/strong&gt;, the office management depends very much on the size and type of Charterer. Charterers’ Ship Chartering Department may be an extremely small and maybe minor part of the organization as a whole. In many such organizations, the principal role is in marketing their products. Likewise with traders, where the major share of profits is to be made in prosperous buying and selling of products rather than in freight activities. Some Charterers realize the requirement to be efficient in chartering as in all other corporate activities and hire qualified Shipbrokers to perform these duties. On the other hand, some Charterers outsource Chartering Department and rely heavily on external Shipbroking Services. The In-House Chartering Department will tend to be more highly staffed than outsourcing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shipbrokers’ Mistakes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;shipbrokers-mistakes&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#shipbrokers-mistakes&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is astonishing that for such a professional and long-established activity as the international shipping, Charterparty Clauses are often poorly drafted and open to miscellaneous interpretations. For example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;**1- Poorly Drafted Time Charterparty Example: **&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“This time charter is for 20 months, with Charterers’ option of a further 12 months, to be declared minimum 3 months prior expiration of the first period. Plus or minus 1 month in Charterers’ option on final period”.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is clear that no later than 17 months into the Charterparty period the Charterer has to declare whether the option to extend the charter by a further 12 months is to be exercised or not. It is also clear that having declared that option, the Charterer can redeliver the ship somewhere between 31 and 33 months after delivery to Time Charter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is not clear is what happens if the Charterers do not declare the extension option. It is almost impossible to redeliver a ship after exactly 20 months unless the ship is kept idle for some time following completion of her discharge immediately previous to the expiration of 20 months. This might mean leaving the ship idle for some days, if not weeks. Yet on the face of it, that is what the clause requires the Charterers to do. There is no 1 month more or less to be applied to the straight 20 months period. This may be legally implied. Equally, it may not. It is an example of a Poorly Drafted Time Charterparty Clause.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;**2- Poorly Drafted Voyage Charterparty Example: **&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“The cargo to be loaded at Shanghai (China) and discharged at Bangkok (Thailand) and Port Kelang (Malaysia)”.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Charterers ordered the ship first to Port Kelang (Malaysia) and then to Bangkok (Thailand) to discharge, lightening at Port Kelang (Malaysia) down to Bangkok (Thailand) draft. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Shipowners insisted on discharging first at Bangkok (Thailand), lightening locally at Kohsichang (Thailand), and then completing discharging at Port Kelang (Malaysia), because this geographic rotation would save them extra steaming and bunker consumption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this case, no mention was made in the charterparty of discharging in geographic rotation, nor was there any clause making discharge port rotation in Charterers’ or Shipowners’ Option. This is another example of a poorly drafted Charterparty Clause. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no legal precedent in English Law that indicates who was right or wrong, but advice ranged from discharging in the order as shown in the charterparty to reference to standard Chartering Books which refer to the “reasonable, direct route”. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;**Wrong Charterparty Form **&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;wrong-charterparty-form&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#wrong-charterparty-form&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are many Charteryparty Forms available. Shipbrokers should be careful not to mix items from totally different types of Charteryparty Forms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the case of MV Jordan II (2003), it was heard by the UK Court of Appeal and decided in the Shipowner’s favor. Since there is the possibility that this case may go to the House of Lords the outcome may yet be reversed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MV Jordan II (2003) case revolves around some damage caused to a steel cargo because of poor stowage. The Bill of Lading (B/L) incorporated the Hague-Visby Rules:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hague-Visby Rules Article III Rule 2 states: “The carrier shall properly and carefully load, handle, stow, carry, keep, care for, and discharge the goods carried”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hague-Visby Rules Rule 8 states: “Any … agreement in a contract of carriage relieving the carrier or ship from liability for loss or damage … arising from negligence, fault or failure in the … obligations provided in this Article… shall be null and void…”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the cargo was steel products the parties had chosen to use the STEMMOR 1983 Voyage Charterparty Form: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;STEMMOR 1983 Voyage Charterparty Form Clause 3 states: “Freight to be paid at … $3.3 per metric ton. F.I.O.S.T. – lashed / secured / dunnaged…”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;STEMMOR 1983 Voyage Charterparty Form Clause 17 states: “Shippers/Charterers/Receivers to put the cargo on board, trim and discharge cargo free of expense to vessel…”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deputy High Court Judge Nigel Teare QC held that neither the shipper nor receiver of a steel cargo nor the voyage charterer were entitled to sue the Jordan II’s Shipowner for alleged damage due to poor stowing and handling. Applying the precedent of Pyrene v Scindia (1954), Deputy High Court Judge Nigel Teare QC ruled that the Hague-Visby Rules (Article III Rule 2) require “proper performance’ of loading, stowing, and carriage by the carrier”, which only applies if the Shipowner had agreed to undertake those functions. The Appeal Court unanimously upheld that decision. The Courts were asked for a preliminary ruling in principle, in advance of the main claim. If the Parties (Shipowner and Charterer) had agreed, the Charterer would pay for the services, was the Shipowner still liable for “defective loading, stowage, lashing, securing, dunnaging, separation and discharge”, and responsible for “proper performance” of the loading or discharging operations?. They had to decide what the Parties (Shipowner and Charterer) had agreed in the Charterparty Form and Bill of Lading (B/L), and whether Hague-Visby still applied. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MV Jordan II was voyage chartered on STEMMOR 1983 Voyage Charterparty Form. Islamic Solidarity Shipping voyage chartered the MV Jordan II to TCI Trans Commodities to carry 5,500 tons of galvanized steel coils from India to Spain in December 1997.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;STEMMOR 1983 Voyage Charterparty Form Clause 3 states: “Freight to be paid per metric ton FIOST (Free In and Out, Stowed and Trimmed) lashed/secured/dunnaged”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;STEMMOR 1983 Voyage Charterparty Form modified Clause 7 states: “Charterers to have full use of all vessel’s gear to assist in loading and discharging”, but only “supplementary to the shore gear”. Shore winchmen and crane men were “to be used at all times”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MV Jordan II was voyage chartered on STEMMOR 1983 Voyage Charterparty Form. STEMMOR 1983 Voyage Charterparty Form was developed for the carriage of bulk ore. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;STEMMOR 1983 Voyage Charterparty Form Clause 17 retained its original wording: “shipper/charterer/receiver were to load, trim and discharge the cargo free of expense to the vessel”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cargo Trimming&lt;/strong&gt; is defined as leveling off the top of the bulk cargo pile. Cargo Trimming is appropriate for bulk cargoes. However, how was Cargo Trimming supposed to apply to steel coils? The charter was subject to English law and incorporated the Hague-Visby Rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In the case of MV Jordan II (2003):&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Shipper (Seller of the Cargo): Jindal Iran and Steel Company Limited&lt;br&gt;
Receiver (Purchaser of the Cargo): Hiansa S.A.&lt;br&gt;
Charterer: TCI Trans Commodities&lt;br&gt;
Shipowner: Islamic Solidarity Shipping Company Jordan Inc&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Islamic Solidarity Shipping Company Jordan Inc is the Shipowner of the MV Jordan II. By a charterparty on the STEMMOR 1983 form dated 4 December 1997 at Hamburg the owners chartered the vessel to TCI Trans Commodities A.G. for a voyage from Mumbai in India to Barcelona and Motril in Spain. Jindal Iran and Steel Company Limited and Hiansa S.A. are respectively the sellers and purchasers of 435 steel coils. The goods were shipped from Mumbai aboard the MV Jordan II as evidenced by two (2) Bills of Lading (B/L) on the Congenbill form, both dated 2 January 1998, which were issued on behalf of the Shipowners at Mumbai. The Bills of Lading (B/L) contained or evidenced contracts of carriage to Motril, in Spain. The Bills of Lading (B/L) named Jindal Iron and Steel Company Limited as the shippers and Hiansa S.A. as consignees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shipper (Seller of the Cargo): Jindal Iran and Steel Company Limited; the Receiver (Purchaser of the Cargo): Hiansa S.A.; and Charterer: TCI Trans Commodities, subsequently started proceedings against Islamic Solidarity Shipping Company Jordan Inc, alleging damage in transit. TCI Trans Commodities sued under the charterparty. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jindal Iran and Steel Company Limited and Hiansa S.A. sued as Bills of Lading (B/L) Holders. Islamic Solidarity Shipping Company Jordan Inc argued it was not liable for the cargo operations, either under the charter or the Bills of Lading (B/L) which were on the Congenbill form and incorporated the charter terms. According to the claimants, Clause 3 was inconsistent with Hague-Visby Rules (Art III R8) and so did not transfer the proper performance obligations from the Shipowner to the cargo interests. Islamic Solidarity Shipping Company Jordan Inc responded that Clause 3 and Clause 17, taken together, transferred both obligations to pay, and to ensure the operations were properly carried out. The judge decided that if Clause 3, with the FIOST provisions, was read with Clause 17, the wording clearly showed the parties intended to transfer to the Charterer the Shipowner’s common law responsibility for performance. The judge stated that “the obligation to trim”, was intended to mean responsibility for lashing, stowing, and dunnage. These were transferred to TCI Trans Commodities, as Charterer, so it could not sue under the charter, while Jindal Iran and Steel Company Limited and Hiansa S.A. could not claim compensation under the Bills of Lading (B/L) so long as the damage was not caused by the Carrier. The parties had agreed to be governed by English law, under which, according to Pyrene v Scindia, Hague-Visby Rules (Art III R2) only applied to the Carrier if Carrier had agreed to carry out the specified functions relating to the cargo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jindal Iran and Steel Company Limited, Hiansa S.A., and TCI Trans Commodities appealed against the judge’s interpretation of the Charterparty, and the effect of Hague-Visby Rules (Art III) on the Bills of Lading (B/L). They contended that although in the case of bulk ore, Clause 17 would have transferred all cargo work obligations to the Charterer, the word trim could not be taken to apply to manufactured steel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Appeal Court judges rejected this argument. The Appeal Court judges agreed with the judge that while FIOST was only a who is to pay provision, the word Free simply means &lt;strong&gt;at no cost to the Shipowner&lt;/strong&gt;, it must be read with Clause 17, which determined the transfer of responsibility. Although trim was inappropriate, the rest of Clause 17 showed the Charterer was to load and discharge the cargo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Appeal Court judges stated that the parties had put their minds to what is required to stow the steel coils, namely, the obligation to lash, secure, and dunnage. Contracting parties intended to transfer the obligation to the Charterer, and there was no other wording to suggest they did not mean this to happen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As to Hague-Visby Rules (Art III), judges confirmed that Pyrene v Scindia, later confirmed by the House of Lords in Renton v Palmyra, was binding in English law. So the effect of the Bills of Lading (B/L) was not invalidated by Rule 8. Hague-Visby Rules (Article III R2) do not compel the Shipowner to be responsible for the loading and unloading or for the way other parties carried out the work. Hague-Visby Rules (Article III R2) simply compels the Shipowner to load and unload properly if the Shipowner undertakes those functions and the Shipowner could contract out of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;VOYLAY Rules****2013 (Voyage Charter Party Laytime Interpretation Rules 2013)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;voylay-rules2013-voyage-charter-party-laytime-interpretation-rules-2013&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#voylay-rules2013-voyage-charter-party-laytime-interpretation-rules-2013&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Laytime and Demurrage are fundamental to Tramp Shipping. Specialist terms which have evolved over the years have been extensively analyzed by legal commentators and frequently tested in the courts. This has resulted in subtle distinctions where a choice of term or use of language can advance or delay the commencement of laytime and mean the difference between demurrage starting on Friday afternoon or the following Monday morning. The Laytime Definitions for Charter Parties 2013 (Laytime Definitions) have been developed to provide practitioners with a set of meanings of commonly-used words and phrases. The objective is to help reduce disputes about party intentions in a market where fixtures are often concluded based on a recap message and listed amendments, without the exchange or return of draft contracts. The Laytime Definitions are available for incorporation into charter parties or possibly used as an agreed reference for dispute resolution. In addition, they can be used as an educational resource to assist industry entrants and others wishing to develop an understanding of the contractual and legal complexities surrounding laytime and demurrage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1976, the Comité Maritime International (CMI), the private international organization for maritime legal interests, began work on a project to reduce charter party disputes by developing definitions of commonly-used terms, starting with laytime provisions. A Working Group comprising representatives from BIMCO, CMI, the UK Chamber of Shipping, and FONASBA, developed the Charter Party Laytime Definitions 1980. However, the Definitions failed to attract support and were rarely incorporated into charter parties. In response to a highly critical report about contractual arrangements in the shipping industry issued by the United Nations Commission on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) in 1990, the Definitions were revised and issued as the &lt;strong&gt;Voyage Charter Party Laytime Interpretation Rules (Voylayrules) 1993&lt;/strong&gt;. Since the publication of Voylayrules, important developments and changes have taken place in case law and commercial practice. A review was therefore put in hand to determine whether the content remained relevant together with the need for any changes, including new or additional provisions, required to meet contemporary trading arrangements. The resulting Laytime Definitions for Charter Parties 2013 were adopted by BIMCO at the Documentary Committee in Paris in May 2013 and have been similarly endorsed by each of the sponsoring organizations. Accordingly, the provisions are issued as a joint document.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Laytime Definitions have been restored to the original 1980 concept and developed as definitions. This is an important change from Voylayrules 1993 which was issued as a self-standing code of rules and differed in several significant respects from generally accepted principles and practice such as the decision to combine three variations of “Weather Working“ day into a single Rule. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sponsoring organizations agreed that the previous radical approach had been a factor contributing to the limited use of Voylayrules and that a fresh approach was required in the development of updated provisions that would be used in the markets. It was therefore agreed to revert to definitions, setting out statements of meaning, and that the content should reflect contemporary market needs based on the current state of English law. As a result, substantive and editorial amendments have been made to a number of the Voylayrules provisions, separate explanations given once again to different forms of “Weather Working” day and new definitions introduced including “Always Accessible” and “Whether in Port or Not”. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The term “Strike”, which was introduced in Voylayrules, has been deleted because the scope and effects are often given their meaning in the underlying charter party. The term “In Writing” has been removed as unnecessary given that many, particularly BIMCO, charter parties include a clause covering the issue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The use of abbreviations has, for the most part, been avoided. In many cases, there is no generally accepted meaning and while parties may understand their exchanges, abbreviations and acronyms can be capable of more than one interpretation. The Laytime Definitions use abbreviations only in respect of Whether in Berth or Not (WIBON) and Whether in Port or Not (WIPON) which are widely understood. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Difference between VOYLAY Rules 1993 and VOYLAY Rules 2013&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;difference-between-voylay-rules-1993-and-voylay-rules-2013&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#difference-between-voylay-rules-1993-and-voylay-rules-2013&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The following notes comment on the updated provisions and highlight changes from or amendments to &lt;strong&gt;VOYLAY Rules****1993&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;**Preamble: **The provisions relate only to laytime and demurrage issues and apply when any or all are expressly incorporated into a charter party or other contract of affreightment. It is for parties to determine the scope of application either limited to certain agreed and identified provisions or by incorporation in extenso. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;List of Definitions:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. PORT&lt;/strong&gt; has been amended to reflect the wider concept of port area explained in The Johanna Oldendorff (1973) with reference now made to “places outside the legal, fiscal or administrative area”. The term “offshore facilities” has been added to the illustrative, but non-exhaustive, list of cargo handling areas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;**2. BERTH **consistent with the amendment to PORT, the restrictive reference to “place within a port” has been replaced by an open-ended list of cargo handling locations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. REACHABLE ON ARRIVAL&lt;/strong&gt; this term has been the subject of considerable litigation over the years. The revised text is based on the current position that delay due to bad weather or congestion or both is a breach of charterers’ obligations. The potentially disputatious qualification “in the absence of an abnormal occurrence”, included in Voylayrules, has been deleted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;**4. ALWAYS ACCESSIBLE **the provision has been treated by the authorities as synonymous with “Reachable on Arrival” in the context of getting into a berth but the position on departure has been less clear. The term has therefore been set out separately with the second sentence covering the position on departure requiring charterers to enable the vessel to leave safely and without delay. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. LAYTIME&lt;/strong&gt; this is unchanged. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6. PER HATCH PER DAY&lt;/strong&gt; and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7. PER WORKING HATCH PER DAY or PER WORKABLE HATCH PER DAY&lt;/strong&gt; Laytime counting by reference to hatch calculations continues to be used, albeit to a limited extent, in some parts of the world. The provisions have been retained unchanged. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8. DAY&lt;/strong&gt; in contrast to Definitions No 9 and 10, an unqualified DAY is now described as a period of twenty-four consecutive hours. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;9. CALENDAR DAY&lt;/strong&gt; is new and covers a period of twenty-four consecutive hours running from 0000 to 2400 hours. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;**10. CONVENTIONAL DAY **is new and has been included in recognition of the fact that a period of twenty-four hours with laytime counting is likely to start at any point during a Calendar Day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;11. WORKING DAY&lt;/strong&gt; the meaning has been brought into line with English law. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;12. RUNNING DAYS or CONSECUTIVE DAYS&lt;/strong&gt; the provision is unchanged. &lt;strong&gt;13. RUNNING HOURS or CONSECUTIVE HOURS&lt;/strong&gt; this is new and reflects practical usage, particularly in tanker charter parties. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;**14. HOLIDAY **this is the (unchanged) mirror image of Definition No 11 WORKING DAY. 15-18 WEATHER WORKING in contrast to the single provision in Voylayrules covering three alternative forms of Weather Working provisions, separate meanings have been restored in line with English law decisions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;15. WEATHER WORKING DAY&lt;/strong&gt; deductions for bad weather are calculated by reference to the length of an interruption during a vessel’s normal (or notional if waiting on a turn) working hours bear to a period of 24 hours. Thus, a two-hour stoppage during an eight-hour working day is pro-rated to six hours (or four hours in the case of a twelve-hour working day) and the time is then added to the end of laytime. No deductions are made for rain occurring outside normal working hours. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;16. WEATHER WORKING DAY OF 24 CONSECUTIVE HOURS&lt;/strong&gt; the actual duration of an interruption for bad weather at any time on a working day during or outside normal working hours and including periods on a turn, is added to the end of laytime. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;17. WEATHER WORKING DAY OF 24 HOURS&lt;/strong&gt; this is an artificial day made up of twenty-four working hours. An eight-hour working day is equal to three calendar days’ laytime but with laytime suspended for stoppages due to bad weather during working hours or during working hours when work was contemplated. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;18. (WORKING DAY) WEATHER PERMITTING&lt;/strong&gt; this has the same meaning and interpretation as Definition No 16 Weather Working Day of 24 Consecutive Hours. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;**19. EXCEPTED or EXCLUDED **the content is unchanged &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;20. UNLESS SOONER COMMENCED&lt;/strong&gt; has the effect of bringing forward the commencement of laytime if work begins before the contractual start of laytime. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;21. UNLESS SOONER COMMENCED, IN WHICH CASE ACTUAL TIME USED TO COUNT&lt;/strong&gt; the commencement of laytime remains per charter party provisions but time used in any prior period will count against laytime. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;22. UNLESS USED&lt;/strong&gt; time used during excepted periods is set against laytime. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;**23. TO AVERAGE LAYTIME **the provision is unchanged. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;24. REVERSIBLE LAYTIME&lt;/strong&gt; the provision is unchanged. Reversibility applies between loading ports and discharging ports but not between loading ports or between discharging ports. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;**25. NOTICE OF READINESS **this is unchanged. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;26. TIME LOST WAITING FOR BERTH TO COUNT AS LOADING OR DISCHARGING TIME or AS LAYTIME&lt;/strong&gt; the basis is unchanged in principle, subject to minor editorial improvements. Where a vessel is unable to berth but cannot tender Notice of Readiness at a waiting place, time lost will count against laytime or, on expiry, as demurrage. Once a berth is available, laytime or demurrage ceases to count until the vessel is at a place where Notice of Readiness can be given and resumes per charter party provisions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;27. WHETHER IN BERTH OR NOT (WIBON) or BERTH OR NO BERTH&lt;/strong&gt; relates to delays due to congestion (but not on account of weather). A change has been made. Under Voylayrules, laytime or demurrage ceased once a berth became available and would not resume until the vessel was at the berth. This meant that the owner would have to bear the risk of any intervening delay, even if not otherwise contractually responsible. An adjustment has therefore been made so that time will always run per the underlying charter party provisions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;28. WHETHER IN PORT OR NOT (WIPON)&lt;/strong&gt; this is new. It will enable an owner to give Notice of Readiness from any recognized waiting place “off the Port” if unable to proceed to the usual waiting place. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;29. VESSEL BEING IN FREE PRATIQUE&lt;/strong&gt; has been amended to address the position in Voylayrules potentially restricting time counting arrangements and possibly conflicting with underlying charter party terms. The content has been streamlined with the reference to Custom House entry removed as formalities vary considerably from one state to another. The provision now relates only to compliance with port health requirements. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;30. DEMURRAGE&lt;/strong&gt; to avoid conflict with the position of many charter parties, the Voylayrules provision that “Demurrage shall not be subject to laytime exceptions” has been qualified by “unless specifically stated in the Charter Party”. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;**31. DESPATCH MONEY or DESPATCH **this is unchanged. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;32. DESPATCH ON ALL WORKING TIME SAVED or ON ALL LAYTIME SAVED&lt;/strong&gt; this is unchanged. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;33. DESPATCH ON ALL TIME SAVED&lt;/strong&gt; this is unchanged. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Incorporation of VOYLAY Rules:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;incorporation-of-voylay-rules&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#incorporation-of-voylay-rules&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;VOYLAY Rules’ provisions have been developed for incorporation into Charterparties. There are several possible means of achieving this objective depending on the type of contractual arrangements (for example single or consecutive voyage charters or a contract of affreightment) and whether the intention is to apply the provisions in full or only those selected by the parties. While other methods might be equally effective, the following alternatives are suggested: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1- Clause for incorporation by reference:&lt;/strong&gt; “The Laytime Definitions for Charter Parties 2013 (Laytime Definitions) are incorporated into this contract in full. In the event of any conflict between this contract and the Laytime Definitions, the provisions of the Laytime Definitions shall prevail to the extent of such conflict.” If it is agreed to incorporate only certain of the Definitions, the text can be modified to read: “Definition Numbers [identify selected provisions] in the Laytime Definitions for Charter Parties 2013 (Laytime Definitions) are incorporated into this contract. In the event of any conflict between this contract and the Laytime Definitions, the provisions of the Laytime Definitions shall prevail to the extent of such conflict.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2- Incorporation using a cut and paste addendum&lt;/strong&gt; setting out the full text of all or of those selected Definitions which the parties have agreed to apply. The incorporation clause should clearly state that the agreed Laytime Definitions prevail in the event of any conflict with the underlying charter party provisions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;**3- Application to individual words or phrases in the body of the Charterparty **where the intention is to remove any doubt about the parties’ intended interpretation of one or more specific terms. In such an event, the text of the relevant Laytime Definition(s) can be inserted as the agreed meaning. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;VOYLAY Rules 2013 (Laytime Definitions For Charterparties 2013)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;voylay-rules-2013-laytime-definitions-for-charterparties-2013&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#voylay-rules-2013-laytime-definitions-for-charterparties-2013&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. PORT&lt;/strong&gt; shall mean any area where vessels load or discharge cargo and shall include, but not be limited to, berths, wharves, anchorages, buoys, and offshore facilities as well as places outside the legal, fiscal, or administrative area where vessels are ordered to wait for their turn no matter the distance from that area. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;**2. BERTH **shall mean the specific place where the Vessel is to load or discharge and shall include, but not be limited to, any wharf, anchorage, offshore facility, or other location used for that purpose. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. REACHABLE ON ARRIVAL&lt;/strong&gt; shall mean that the charterer undertakes that an available loading or discharging Berth be provided to the Vessel on arrival at the Port which the Vessel can reach safely without delay. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;**4. ALWAYS ACCESSIBLE **shall mean that the charterer undertakes that an available loading or discharging Berth be provided to the Vessel on arrival at the Port which the Vessel can reach safely without delay. The charterer additionally undertakes that the Vessel will be able to depart safely from the Berth and without delay at any time before, during, or on completion of loading or discharging. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. LAYTIME&lt;/strong&gt; shall mean the period agreed between the parties during which the owner will make and keep the Vessel available for loading or discharging without payment additional to the freight. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6. PER HATCH PER DAY&lt;/strong&gt; shall mean that the Laytime is to be calculated by dividing the quantity of cargo by the result of multiplying the agreed daily rate per hatch by the number of the Vessel’s hatches. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Laytime = Quantity of Cargo / (Daily Rate x Number of Hatches) = Days&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each pair of parallel twin hatches shall count as one hatch. Nevertheless, a hatch that is capable of being worked by two gangs simultaneously shall be counted as two hatches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;**7. PER WORKING HATCH PER DAY or PER WORKABLE HATCH PER DAY **shall mean that the Laytime is to be calculated by dividing the quantity of cargo in the hold with the largest quantity by the result of multiplying the agreed daily rate per working or workable hatch by the number of hatches serving that hold. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Laytime = Largest Quantity in One Hold / (Daily Rate Per Hatch x Number of Hatches Serving that Hold) = Days&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each pair of parallel twin hatches shall count as one hatch. Nevertheless, a hatch that is capable of being worked by two gangs simultaneously shall be counted as two hatches. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8. DAY&lt;/strong&gt; shall mean a period of twenty-four (24) consecutive hours. Any part of a Day shall be counted pro rata. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;**9. CALENDAR DAY **shall mean a period of twenty-four (24) consecutive hours running from 0000 hours to 2400 hours. Any part of a Calendar Day shall be counted pro rata. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;10. CONVENTIONAL DAY&lt;/strong&gt; shall mean a period of twenty-four (24) consecutive hours running from any identified time. Any part of a Conventional Day shall be counted pro rata. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;**11. WORKING DAY **shall mean a Day when by local law or practice work is normally carried out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;12. RUNNING DAYS or CONSECUTIVE DAYS&lt;/strong&gt; shall mean Days that follow one immediately after the other. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;**13. RUNNING HOURS or CONSECUTIVE HOURS **shall mean hours that follow one immediately after the other. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;14. HOLIDAY&lt;/strong&gt; shall mean a Day other than the normal weekly Day(s) of rest, or part thereof, when by local law or practice work during what would otherwise be ordinary working hours is not normally carried out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;15. WEATHER WORKING DAY&lt;/strong&gt; shall mean a Working Day or part of a Working Day during which it is or, if the Vessel is still waiting for her turn, it would be possible to load/discharge the cargo without interruption due to the weather. If such interruption occurs (or would have occurred if work had been in progress), there shall be excluded from the Laytime a period calculated by reference to the ratio which the duration of the interruption bears to the time which would have or could have been worked but for the interruption. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;**16. WEATHER WORKING DAY OF 24 CONSECUTIVE HOURS **shall mean a Working Day or part of a Working Day of 24 consecutive hours during which it is or, if the vessel is still waiting for her turn, it would be possible to load/discharge the cargo without interruption due to the weather. If such interruption occurs (or would have occurred if work had been in progress) there shall be excluded from the Laytime period during which the weather interrupted or would have interrupted work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;**17. WEATHER WORKING DAY OF 24 HOURS **shall mean a period of 24 hours made up of one or more Working Days during which it is or, if the Vessel is still waiting for her turn, it would be possible to load/discharge the cargo without interruption due to the weather. If such interruption occurs (or would have occurred if work had been in progress), there shall be excluded from Laytime the actual period of such interruption. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;18. (WORKING DAY) WEATHER PERMITTING&lt;/strong&gt; shall have the same meaning as WEATHER WORKING DAY OF 24 CONSECUTIVE HOURS. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;19. EXCEPTED or EXCLUDED&lt;/strong&gt; shall mean that the Days specified do not count as Laytime even if loading or discharging is carried out on them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;**20. UNLESS SOONER COMMENCED **shall mean that if turn-time has not expired but loading or discharging is carried out, Laytime shall commence. &lt;strong&gt;21. UNLESS SOONER COMMENCED, IN WHICH CASE ACTUAL TIME USED TO COUNT&lt;/strong&gt; shall mean that actual time used during turn-time shall count as Laytime. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;**22. UNLESS USED **shall mean that if Laytime has commenced but loading or discharging is carried out during excepted periods, actual time used shall count as Laytime. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;23. TO AVERAGE LAYTIME&lt;/strong&gt; shall mean that separate calculations are to be made for loading and discharging and that any time saved in one operation is to be set off against any excess time used in the other. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;**24. REVERSIBLE LAYTIME **shall mean an option given to the charterer to add together the time allowed for loading and discharging. Where the option is exercised the effect is the same as a total time being specified to cover both operations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;25. NOTICE OF READINESS&lt;/strong&gt; shall mean the notice to the charterer, shipper, receiver, or other people as required by the Charter Party that the Vessel has arrived at the Port or Berth, as the case may be, and is ready to load or discharge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;**26. TIME LOST WAITING FOR BERTH TO COUNT AS LOADING OR DISCHARGING TIME or AS LAYTIME **shall mean that if no loading or discharging Berth is available and the Vessel is unable to tender Notice of Readiness at the waiting place then any time lost to the Vessel is counted as if Laytime were running, or as time on Demurrage if Laytime has expired. Such time ceases to count once the Berth becomes available. When the Vessel reaches a place where she can tender Notice of Readiness, Laytime or time on Demurrage resumes after such tender and, in respect of Laytime, on expiry of any notice time provided in the CharterParty. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;**27. WHETHER IN BERTH OR NOT (WIBON) or BERTH OR NO BERTH **shall mean that if the designated loading or discharging Berth is not available on arrival, the Vessel on reaching any usual waiting place at the Port, shall be entitled to tender Notice of Readiness from it and Laytime shall commence per the Charterparty. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;28. WHETHER IN PORT OR NOT (WIPON)&lt;/strong&gt; shall mean that if the designated loading or discharging Berth and the usual waiting place at the Port are not available on arrival, the Vessel shall be entitled to tender Notice of Readiness from any recognized waiting place off the Port and Laytime shall commence per the Charterparty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;**29. VESSEL BEING IN FREE PRATIQUE **shall mean that the Vessel complies with port health requirements. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;30. DEMURRAGE&lt;/strong&gt; shall mean an agreed amount payable to the owner in respect of delay to the Vessel once the Laytime has expired, for which the owner is not responsible. Demurrage shall not be subject to exceptions that apply to Laytime unless specifically stated in the Charter Party. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;**31. DESPATCH MONEY or DESPATCH **shall mean an agreed amount payable by the Shipowner of the Vessel completes loading or discharging before the Laytime has expired. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;32. DESPATCH ON ALL WORKING TIME SAVED or ON ALL LAYTIME SAVED&lt;/strong&gt; shall mean that Despatch Money shall be payable for the time from the completion of loading or discharging until the expiry of the Laytime excluding any periods excepted from the Laytime. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;33. DESPATCH ON ALL TIME SAVED&lt;/strong&gt; shall mean that Despatch Money shall be payable for the time from the completion of loading or discharging to the expiry of the Laytime including periods excepted from the Laytime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Time Charter Interpretation Code 2000&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;time-charter-interpretation-code-2000&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#time-charter-interpretation-code-2000&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;FONASBA (The Federation of National Associations of Ship Brokers and Agents) produced Time Charter Interpretation Code 2000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where any of this code conflicts with any of the terms of the relevant time charter, those of the latter shall prevail to that extent, but no further.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In commercial practice, many aims and objectives for standardization are often frustrated by the laws in different jurisdictions and where the legal understanding and interpretation may differ one from the other. The main jurisdictions applicable to maritime disputes are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1- The Common Law countries mainly England and the USA. &lt;br&gt;
2- The Civil Law countries such as France, Germany, Italy, etc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The endeavor is not going to be the alter-ego of the Laytime Definitions for Voyage Charters; nor is this an attempt to create new charter party clauses, but merely a Code of how to interpret existing charter party clauses as well as to assist disputing parties where charter parties are silent or non-determining. There is a vast difference between definition and interpretation, but in some ways and sometimes they may compliment one another. For example, nobody in shipping needs a definition of what speed and consumption are or mean, but how should one deal with a speed claim, if any? The chief objective of the Code is to try to eliminate many often occurring and avoidable maritime charter parties’ disputes in the field of the Time Charter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Speed and Consumption:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;1-speed-and-consumption&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#1-speed-and-consumption&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The following is to apply to any dry cargo time charter not containing a performance clause, and to any combination carrier when engaged in dry cargo trading:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The speed and consumption warranties of the time charter are to apply for its duration and whether the vessel is fully, partly loaded, or in ballast, and shall be computed by the pilot station to pilot station on all sea passages while the vessel is on hire, &lt;strong&gt;excluding&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1a-&lt;/strong&gt; Any day on which winds of Beaufort Wind Scale 4 or above are encountered for more than six (6) consecutive hours;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1b-&lt;/strong&gt; Any time during which speed is deliberately reduced for reasons of safety, or on charterers’ orders to steam at economical or reduced speed, or when the vessel is navigating within confined waters, or when assisting vessels in distress;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1c-&lt;/strong&gt; Any complete sea passage of less than 24 hours duration from pilot station to pilot station;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1d-&lt;/strong&gt; Periods in which time is lost on charterers’ instructions or due to causes expressly excepted under terms of the time charter;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1e-&lt;/strong&gt; Periods when the vessels’ speed is reduced because of hull fouling caused by charterers’ trading orders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When specific figures have been agreed to for the vessel in the ballasted condition there shall be taken into consideration as shall agree on specifics for reduced or economical speed and consumption, when computations are made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mileage made good during qualifying periods shall be divided by the warranted speed and compared to the time spent. Any excess is to be treated as off-hire. If the word ‘about’ precedes the speed and consumption, the same will be understood to mean ½ knot less in the speed and 5% more in the consumption, not be cumulative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As to consumption, the recorded qualifying periods, as above shall be multiplied by the warranted consumption on the qualifying days and compared to the actual consumption. In case of any excess, the charterers are to be compensated by the owners for such excess in cost to the charterers calculated at the prices at the last port bunkers were supplied during the time charter, or those at delivery whichever is applicable. Such an amount may be deducted from the hire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The immediate financial consequences of a speed deficiency shall be set off with any savings caused by under-consumption. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The computations shall be made sea passage by sea passage. The vessel’s speed and consumption shall be reviewed at the end of each twelve months, or other lesser period as appropriate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If in respect of any such review period it is found that the vessel’s speed has fallen below the warranted speed, hire shall be reduced by an amount equivalent to the loss in time involved at the rate of hire. And if in respect of any review period it is found that the vessel’s consumption has exceeded the warranted consumption, the additional costs shall be borne by the owners. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The foregoing is without prejudice to any other claims that a party may have on the other. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Withdrawal for Late Payment/Non-Payment of Hire:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;2-withdrawal-for-late-paymentnon-payment-of-hire&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#2-withdrawal-for-late-paymentnon-payment-of-hire&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Except where otherwise specifically permitted in the provisions of the charter party, the charterers shall have no right to make arbitrary deductions from hire which shall remain payable punctually and regularly as stipulated therein. Nothing in the charter party shall, however, prejudice the charterers’ right to make any equitable set-off against a hire payment due provided that the calculation is reasonably made bona fide and that it is in respect of a claim arising directly out of their deprivation of the use of the vessel in whole or in part. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Except as provided herein, the owners shall have a right of permanent withdrawal of their vessel when payment of hire has not been received by their bankers by the due date because of oversight, negligence, errors, or omissions of charterers or their bankers. In such cases before effecting a withdrawal of the vessel, the owners shall put the charterers on preliminary notice of their failure to pay to hire on the due date, following which the charterers shall be given two clear banking days to remedy the default. Where the breach has been cured the payment shall be deemed to have been made punctually. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a payment of hire made in due time, but insufficient in amount, the owners shall be permitted a reasonable time to verify the correctness of a deduction. If thereafter, there is found to be disagreement on the amount of the deduction, then the amount in dispute shall be placed in escrow by the charterers and the matter referred to immediate arbitration per the terms of the charter party’s arbitration clause. In that event, there shall be no right of withdrawal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Except as provided heretofore, withdrawal of the vessel may be made by the owners, which shall be without prejudice to any other claim they may otherwise have on the charterers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Off-hire:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;3-off-hire&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#3-off-hire&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Any period qualifying as off-hire under terms of the charter party shall be allowed to the charterers for any time lost more than three consecutive hours for each occurrence. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to matters referred to as off-hire in the charter party, shall be included time lost to the charterers caused by interference by a legal, port of governmental authority, resulting in the charterers being deprived of their unfettered use of the vessel at any given time during the currency of the charter party, or in the vessel being prevented from leaving the jurisdiction contrary to charterers’ requirements. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Deviation:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;4-deviation&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#4-deviation&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;All periods of off-hire due to deviation shall run from the commencement of the loss of time to charterers, deviation or putting back, and shall continue until the vessel is again in a fully efficient state to resume her service from a position not less favorable to the charterers than that at which the loss of time, deviation or putting back occurred. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. Legitimacy of the Last Voyage:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;5-legitimacy-of-the-last-voyage&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#5-legitimacy-of-the-last-voyage&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the absence of any specific provision in the time charter relating to redelivery and orders for the final voyage, the following shall apply: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Charterers undertake to arrange the vessel’s trading so as to permit redelivery within the period and permissible redelivery area as contained in the charter party. As soon as the charterers have arranged the final voyage they shall immediately so inform the owners giving a realistic estimated itinerary up to redelivery time. The owners shall notify the charterers within two working days thereafter as to whether they agree or disagree with charterers’ estimate. Should they disagree and consider the vessel will overlap the maximum period, they shall nonetheless allow the voyage to be undertaken at the time charter rate of the charter party without prejudice to their ultimate right to compensation for additional hire at the market rate should an overlap subsequently have proven to have occurred, and should the market rate be higher than the charter party rate of hire. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;London Maritime Arbitrators Association (LMAA) Arbitration Clause&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;london-maritime-arbitrators-association-lmaaarbitration-clause&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#london-maritime-arbitrators-association-lmaaarbitration-clause&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;After consultation with the LMAA (London Maritime Arbitrators Association), BIMCO (Baltic and International Maritime Council) has adopted and is recommending the following amended arbitration clause, which the LMAA (London Maritime Arbitrators Association) recommends for future use in place of the present LMAA (London Maritime Arbitrators Association) Clause: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(a)&lt;/strong&gt; “This Contract shall be governed by and construed in accordance with English law and any dispute arising out of or in connection with this Contract shall be referred to arbitration in London in accordance with the Arbitration Act 1996 or any statutory modification or re-enactment thereof save to the extent necessary to give effect to the provisions of this Clause. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The arbitration shall be conducted in accordance with the London Maritime Arbitrators Association (LMAA) Terms current at the time when the arbitration proceedings are commenced. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reference shall be to three arbitrators. A party wishing to refer a dispute to arbitration shall appoint its arbitrator and send notice of such appointment in writing to the other party requiring the other party to appoint its arbitrator within 14 calendar days of that notice and stating that it will appoint its arbitrator as sole arbitrator unless the other party appoints its arbitrator and give notice that it has done so within the 14 days specified. If the other party does not appoint its arbitrator and give notice that it has done so within the 14 days specified, the party referring a dispute to arbitration may, without the requirement of any further prior notice to the other party, appoint its arbitrator as sole arbitrator and shall advise the other party accordingly. The award of a sole arbitrator shall be binding on both parties as if he had been appointed by agreement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nothing herein shall prevent the parties from agreeing in writing to vary these provisions to provide for the appointment of a sole arbitrator. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In cases where neither the claim nor any counterclaim exceeds the sum of US$50,000 or such other sum as the parties may agree, the arbitration shall be conducted in accordance with the LMAA Small Claims Procedure current at the time when the arbitration proceedings are commenced. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(b)&lt;/strong&gt; Notwithstanding (a) above, the parties may agree at any time to refer to mediation any difference and/or dispute arising out of or in connection with this Contract. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the case of a dispute in respect of which arbitration has been commenced under (a), above, the following shall apply:-&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1-&lt;/strong&gt; Either party may at any time and from time to time elect to refer the dispute or part of the dispute to mediation by service on the other party of a written notice (the “Mediation Notice”) calling on the other party to agree to mediation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2-&lt;/strong&gt; The other party shall thereupon within 14 calendar days of receipt of the Mediation Notice confirm that they agree to mediation, in which case the parties shall thereafter agree on a mediator within a further 14 calendar days, failing which on the application of either party a mediator will be appointed promptly by the Arbitration Tribunal (“the Tribunal”) or such person as the Tribunal may designate for that purpose. The mediation shall be conducted in such place and accordance with such procedure and on such terms as the parties may agree or, in the event of disagreement, as may be set by the mediator. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3-&lt;/strong&gt; If the other party does not agree to mediate, that fact may be brought to the attention of the Tribunal and may be taken into account by the Tribunal when allocating the costs of the arbitration between the parties. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4-&lt;/strong&gt; The mediation shall not affect the right of either party to seek such relief or take such steps as it considers necessary to protect its interest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5-&lt;/strong&gt; Either party may advise the Tribunal that they have agreed to mediation. The arbitration procedure shall continue during the conduct of the mediation but the Tribunal may take the mediation timetable into account when setting the timetable for steps in the arbitration. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6-&lt;/strong&gt; Unless otherwise agreed or specified in the mediation terms, each party shall bear its costs incurred in the mediation and the parties shall share equally the mediator’s costs and expenses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7-&lt;/strong&gt; The mediation process shall be without prejudice and confidential and no information or documents disclosed during it shall be revealed to the Tribunal except to the extent that they are disclosable under the law and procedure governing the arbitration. “&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: The parties should be aware that the mediation process may not necessarily interrupt time limits. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;–&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dispute Resolution in Ship Chartering&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;Arbitration has been a longstanding method of resolving disputes in ship chartering, with its origins dating back hundreds of years. The English courts have recognized and supported maritime arbitration since the first Arbitration Act of 1698. In the context of ship chartering, arbitration provides a means of settling commercial disputes without resorting to court. Originally, arbitration was conceived as a non-legal approach to resolving seemingly intractable disputes, with arbitrators typically being individuals with a commercial background.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taking a dispute to court can be a time-consuming and costly process, as well as being conducted in a very public manner. It can also, as anyone who has been through litigation can attest, generate a great deal of animosity between the parties involved. Companies or individuals who recognize the need to resolve disputes but who want to maintain a friendly relationship with their adversary may opt for the comparatively more amicable process of maritime arbitration. This is often the case when the parties will need to continue to work together in a business capacity, despite the dispute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s important not to underestimate the formality of maritime arbitration proceedings. While they may not be as intricate or strict as court proceedings, they still maintain a judicial essence, as they serve as an alternative to court proceedings. Typically, a contract such as a charter party will include an arbitration clause. This clause states that should a dispute arise, the parties intend to resolve it through arbitration rather than through court proceedings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Advantages of Maritime Arbitration&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;advantages-of-maritime-arbitration&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#advantages-of-maritime-arbitration&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are several advantages to maritime arbitration:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;**1- Expertise: ** Due to the selection of a specialist arbitrator, one who possesses expert knowledge within the particular field of contention, the parties are not required to devote valuable time and effort towards acquainting the judge with the intricate technicalities underlying the dispute at hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2- Flexibility:&lt;/strong&gt; In a court of law, strict procedures must be adhered to. However, in arbitration proceedings, the parties are afforded the opportunity to establish their own rules of conduct. They may elect to maintain the formality of a High Court hearing, complete with leading counsel representing each party, or opt for a more informal approach where they convene around a table with the arbitrator, without legal representation. The process is customized to meet the specific demands of the particular dispute, thus potentially saving both time and financial resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3- Privacy:&lt;/strong&gt; Arbitration in the United Kingdom is a private affair and the decision of the arbitrator is solely shared with the parties involved in the dispute. This is particularly favorable in commercial disagreements where companies may choose to keep their disagreements out of the public eye. On the contrary, in certain other countries, such as the USA, arbitration awards are made available to the public. In most jurisdictions, court proceedings are open to the general public, and comprehensive reports of all legal cases, like the Lloyd’s List Law Reports, are routinely published.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;**4- Finality: **In the process of litigation, an appeals procedure exists, which may eventually escalate to the House of Lords. However, in the case of arbitration, the decision reached is final and binding, barring only the most exceptional circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disadvantages of Maritime Arbitration&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;disadvantages-of-maritime-arbitration&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#disadvantages-of-maritime-arbitration&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the aforementioned benefits, the arbitration system does entail its own level of formality and can lead to delays. There has been a growing inclination for parties to engage legal representation, and if one party chooses to appoint both a solicitor and a barrister (an attorney and advocate, respectively), the other party may feel disadvantaged if they do not do the same. This consequently leads to a lengthier and more costly procedure. Furthermore, arbitration no longer maintains the expediency it was once known for, primarily due to the fact that acknowledged experts in the realm of shipping have increasingly busy schedules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Maritime Arbitration Centres&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;maritime-arbitration-centres&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#maritime-arbitration-centres&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Almost every country incorporates some form of arbitration as part of its judicial framework, and many of the distinguished ‘maritime nations’ have dedicated groups specializing in arbitration for the shipping community. The two primary centers for maritime arbitration are located in London and New York. In London, the controlling entity is the** London Maritime Arbitrators Association (LMAA)**, while in New York, it is the &lt;strong&gt;Society of Maritime Arbitrators (SMA)&lt;/strong&gt;. Both of these organizations provide comprehensive arbitration services, and their rules bear many similarities. Both encourage the parties to agree on appointing a single arbitrator, while also providing provisions for each party to appoint their own arbitrator, with a third arbitrator being appointed in certain circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the London Maritime Arbitrators Association (LMAA) Rules, this third arbitrator assumes the role of an** “umpire”** in case of a deadlock, while in the New York Rules, the third member becomes the Chairman of the tribunal, and a majority decision is permissible unless an umpire is specifically requested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is essential for both the appointee and appointer to bear in mind that an arbitrator’s role is akin to that of a judge, rather than an advocate, except in those exceptional instances when an umpire is appointed, and the two arbitrators present their arguments as advocates, with the umpire’s decision being final.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;**Small Claims Procedures **&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;small-claims-procedures&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#small-claims-procedures&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many shipping voyages and time charter contracts often involve relatively minor but irritating disputed amounts, which can delay the process of finalizing figures and settling accounts between the parties. These disputes may not justify the costs and time involved in a full and formal arbitral hearing, but can still linger as commercial sores, hindering the negotiation of mutually beneficial contracts between the parties. Simplified arbitration procedures are available for such disputes, offering a swift and cost-effective means of resolving relatively uncomplicated or small claims, thus bringing arbitration within reach of those with genuine grievances where existing procedures resulted in incurring disproportionate costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each association has issued details of its respective schemes, including the** LMAA Small Claims Procedure 1989** (Revised 1st January 2002), and the &lt;strong&gt;SMA Shortened Claims Procedure&lt;/strong&gt;, which can be obtained from their respective offices or websites. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the Society of Maritime Arbitrators (SMA) scheme, the maximum amount at dispute is left to the decision of the contracting parties, while the London Maritime Arbitrators Association (LMAA) originally recommended a maximum of US$25,000 but now suggests US$50,000 in the latest revision. Both associations stress that these schemes are not suitable for complex issues or disputes requiring significant examination of witnesses, even if the sum in dispute falls within this limitation. However, the procedure may be feasible for handling claims larger than US$50,000 if there is a single, straightforward issue to be resolved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The London Maritime Arbitrators Association (LMAA) scheme mandates a sole arbitrator, which is also preferred by the Society of Maritime Arbitrators (SMA), although the New York body does not rule out a larger panel. In both cases, the arbitrators’ fees are fixed at a reasonable level, with the LMAA specifying a current fixed fee of £1250 for a sole arbitrator (with £500 extra if the respondent files a counter-claim), and the SMA stipulating US$1500 for each participating arbitrator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The arbitrator has the sole discretion to award costs, which under London Maritime Arbitrators Association (LMAA) terms are limited to £1,750. Usually, there is no oral presentation by the parties unless the arbitrator deems it necessary. The Small Claims procedure aims to provide the award within a month of receiving all the papers from the parties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the case of London, the right of appeal to the courts is specifically excluded, and each party is required to confirm in writing its agreement to this procedure&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LMAA FALCA (Fast and Low-Cost Arbitration)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;lmaa-falca-fast-and-low-cost-arbitration&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#lmaa-falca-fast-and-low-cost-arbitration&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;LMAA FALCA (Fast and Low-Cost Arbitration) is an arbitration procedure designed to provide a quick and efficient resolution to disputes involving more complex cases, allowing for a longer time frame compared to the **“Small Claims Procedure.” **This procedure is limited to English Law, with a maximum recommended sum in dispute of $250,000. Similar to the Small Claims Procedure, a single arbitrator is involved, and oral presentations are only permitted in exceptional cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another system of dispute resolution is &lt;strong&gt;Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR)&lt;/strong&gt;, which involves a mediator who works towards facilitating a mutually agreed-upon resolution based on their advice and suggestions. This is a cost-effective and quick method of resolving relatively small and uncomplicated disputes. If the mediation process proves unsuccessful, the parties can resort to one of the various forms of arbitration available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The London Maritime Arbitrators Association (LMAA) has formalized this form of dispute resolution under the &lt;strong&gt;London Maritime Arbitrators Association (LMAA) Conciliation Terms 1991.&lt;/strong&gt; Similarly, the SMA New York has a Conciliation procedure as outlined in the Rules published in 1988. Additionally, the Society of Maritime Arbitrators (SMA) published a Mediation service in 1999, which complements the conciliation procedure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Arbitration Reference&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;arbitration-reference&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#arbitration-reference&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Arbitration is typically associated with parties mutually agreeing to utilize this method to address a dispute, either through the inclusion of a clause in their contract or at the time the dispute arises.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, it is also possible for a court to refer any question that arises in a legal matter before it to an official or special referee for inquiry or report. In certain cases, the entire issue may be referred to an official or special referee for trial if certain conditions are met. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These conditions include: the consent of all parties involved, the need for a prolonged examination of documents or scientific/local investigation, or if the matter in dispute involves wholly or in part matters of account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;**Arbitration Act 1996 **&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;arbitration-act-1996&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#arbitration-act-1996&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Arbitration Act 1996 was implemented in the United Kingdom in January 1997, with the dual purpose of consolidating the previous legislation, the Arbitration Act 1979, and introducing several changes. The goal of drafting the Arbitration Act 1996 was to restate the law of arbitration in plain English, utilizing a logical format that covers the entire process, starting from the arbitration agreements and progressing to the appointment of an arbitrator, the conduct of the proceedings, and the issuance of awards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The most significant changes introduced by the Arbitration Act of 1996 include:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;the-most-significant-changes-introduced-by-the-arbitration-act-of-1996-include&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#the-most-significant-changes-introduced-by-the-arbitration-act-of-1996-include&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;**1- Arbitration****Appeals: **The Arbitration Act 1996 significantly restricts the right to appeal an arbitration award. While the right to appeal on a point of law (Section 69) remains unchanged, an agreement not to have a reasoned award eliminates the right to appeal. An application for leave to appeal must be filed within 28 days of the award’s date. According to Section 69(3), for leave to be granted, the court must be satisfied that the question’s determination will substantially affect the rights of one or more parties, and it is a matter that the tribunal was initially asked to resolve. This point enshrines the guidelines established in The Nema (1982) case, which dictate that courts will not intervene unless “the arbitrator had misdirected himself in law or that his decision was such that no reasonable arbitrator could reach.” If the disputed issue was not raised before the arbitrators, an application for leave to appeal cannot be made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the event of an appeal, the court has several options:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A- The court may confirm the award;&lt;br&gt;
B- The court may vary the award;&lt;br&gt;
C- The court may set aside the award, either wholly or partially;&lt;br&gt;
D- The court may remit the award back to the arbitrators either in its entirety or relevant sections of it, for them to reconsider in the light of the court’s decision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;**2- Arbitration Costs: **The manner in which costs should be allocated under the new statute is addressed in Sections 59-65, inclusive. A brief summary of the rules is as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A- the parties may agree that one or other of them should pay all or part of the costs provided that they make such an agreement after the dispute has arisen (section 60);&lt;br&gt;
B- subject to (a) above, the tribunal may make an award allocating costs between the parties (section 61 (1));&lt;br&gt;
C- costs should follow the event as a general principle unless the parties otherwise agree. Under this subsection, the arbitrators have the discretion to vary any allocation of costs as they see fit and as may be appropriate to the circumstances of a particular case (section 62 (2)). This is a restatement of what has been the custom and practice of arbitrators previously;&lt;br&gt;
D- where costs are made subject to an agreement between the parties, the costs shall be deemed to be recoverable unless otherwise expressly stated;&lt;br&gt;
E- the parties are free to agree on what costs are recoverable (section 63 (1)). But in the absence of any such agreement, the tribunal has the power to determine what costs are recoverable in whatever manner it thinks fit (section 63 (2 &amp;amp; 3));&lt;br&gt;
F- if they omit to do so, the parties may invoke the aid of the court (section 63 (4)).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;**3- Award Security for Costs: **Under the new statute, the court no longer possesses the authority to award security for costs in arbitrations. In the Ken Ren (1995) case, the House of Lords’ decision, which confirmed that the courts could award security for costs in international arbitrations, caused “widespread dismay” in the international arbitration community, as per Lord Saville. (Coppée Lavalin SA v Ken Ren Chemicals &amp;amp; Fertilisers (1995)). While the arbitral tribunal has the power to award security for costs (Section 38), the parties may agree to exclude this power from their tribunal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4- Arbitration Delayed Proceedings:&lt;/strong&gt; According to section 41 of the new statute, the arbitral tribunal may dismiss a claim if it finds that the claimant has unreasonably and unjustifiably delayed in pursuing their claim. Therefore, it is apparent that the tribunal’s function is no longer limited to determining the dispute’s merits. Before the introduction of section 13A of the Arbitration Act 1950, under the Courts and Legal Services Act 1990, arbitrators lacked the authority to dismiss a claim for want of prosecution. On the other hand, in The Boucraa (1993) case, the Court of Appeal held that this power is not retroactive, implying that arbitrators can only consider delays occurring after January 1, 1992, while exercising their power of dismissal. This, however, does not imply that the statutory provision does not apply to arbitrations entered into before January 1, 1992.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On appeal, the House of Lords ruled that the power granted to arbitrators by section 13A of the Arbitration Act 1950 to dismiss a claim for the delay is partially retroactive. This implies that, while deciding whether to exercise their new power, arbitrators can consider the claimant’s delay in pursuing their claim before January 1, 1992. However, this final appeal decision has been criticized as “surprising” as it seems to violate the principle of non-retroactivity, which is a common law rule that a statute should not be interpreted retroactively if it would have an adverse impact on an existing right or obligation unless it is necessary based on the language used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5- Foreign and Domestic Arbitrations:&lt;/strong&gt; The Arbitration Act of 1996 has abolished the distinction between foreign and domestic arbitrations. Section 46 introduces a new commercial innovation, which allows arbitrators to make their decision based on considerations other than the law of the contract if agreed upon by the parties or determined by the tribunal, thus emphasizing that arbitration is fundamentally a commercial service. Several Acts of Parliament provide for the resolution of disputes through arbitration, outlining the arbitration procedures to be followed. In all other cases, the Arbitration Acts of 1950-1979 apply, which serve as the statutory regulation of the law related to arbitration. The principal Act is the Arbitration Act of 1950, which also incorporates two international measures. The objective of the Arbitration Act of 1975 is to implement the New York Convention in the United Kingdom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;**Arbitration Agreement **&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;arbitration-agreement&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#arbitration-agreement&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A reference to arbitration by agreement of the parties must have its origin in an arbitration agreement, which can be made verbally or in writing. It is important to note that the Arbitration Acts of 1950-1979 only apply to written agreements. However, it has been established that an agreement by telex is considered “an agreement in writing,” as held in the case of Arab African Energy Corporation Ltd. v Olieprodukten Nederland BV (1983). According to Section 32 of the 1950 Act, an arbitration agreement is defined as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“A written agreement to submit present or future differences to arbitration, whether an arbitrator is named therein or not”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Impact of the Arbitration Agreement&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;the-impact-of-the-arbitration-agreement&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#the-impact-of-the-arbitration-agreement&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;An arbitration agreement can be drafted in a way that precludes any right to court proceedings until an award has been made, thereby making the award a condition precedent to the right to sue. Such a clause is commonly referred to as a** Scott v Avery Clause**.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scott v Avery (1856) Case&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the landmark case of Scott v Avery (1856), a ship insurance policy stated that in the event of loss, the amount of loss would be referred to arbitration, and the award of the arbitrators would be a condition precedent to the maintenance of an action. It was ruled that no action could be maintained until an award was made. Section 25(4) of the 1950 Act provides that if the court orders that the agreement to refer the dispute to arbitration shall cease to have an effect, it may also order that the condition precedent shall cease to have an effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a party to an arbitration agreement initiates legal proceedings in court contrary to their commitment to arbitration, the court, upon the other party’s request, may either order a stay of court proceedings to allow the arbitration to continue, or reject the request for a stay, thereby breaking the arbitration agreement (Section 4 of the 1950 Act). If the only issue at stake is a point of law, the court may be inclined to reject the stay of proceedings. However, in most cases, the court will grant the stay and give effect to the arbitration clause. It is important to differentiate here between a ‘domestic arbitration agreement’ and a ‘non-domestic arbitration agreement’. The court’s discretion to order or refuse a stay of court proceedings is wide in cases where the arbitration agreement is a domestic arbitration agreement (Section 4(1) of the 1950 Act), but if it is a non-domestic arbitration agreement, its discretion is limited (Arbitration Act 1975, Section 1).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;An Arbitration Agreement is considered Domestic if, at the time the proceedings are initiated:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A- It does not explicitly or implicitly establish arbitration in a country other than the United Kingdom, and&lt;br&gt;
B- All the parties to the Arbitration Agreement are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;UK citizens or individuals who are habitually residing in the United Kingdom; or&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;corporations that are incorporated in the United Kingdom or have their central management and control exercised in the United Kingdom [1975 Act, Section 1(4)].&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For an arbitration agreement to be classified as domestic, both of these conditions must be met.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Arbitration Act 1979&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;arbitration-act-1979&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#arbitration-act-1979&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The primary objective of the Arbitration Act 1996 was to streamline the Arbitration Act 1979, and some of the implications of the 1979 Act are worth examining.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Judicial Review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Arbitration Act 1979 introduced changes to the system of ‘judicial review’ of arbitration awards. Judicial review is the process by which the High Court reviews the proceedings of arbitration, or any lower court tribunal, to ensure that the rules of ‘natural justice’ have been followed and that the parties have received a fair hearing. The term ‘natural justice’ refers to the principle that all individuals have the right to have their case heard in accordance with legal procedural rules. Therefore, a breach of natural justice occurs when the rules of procedure or administration are not adhered to. The phrase has no connection with the application of equity and equitable remedies. In other words, natural justice is not a provision of ‘fairness’ but of ‘compliance with the rules.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The High Court also ensures that the arbitrators have not acted beyond their powers, which is another aspect of ‘natural justice.’ Although a judicial review of arbitration is still possible, the Arbitration Act 1979 significantly limited the procedure concerning arbitration. It is no longer possible to have a review of findings of fact. The new procedure is outlined in Section 1(2) of the Arbitration Act 1979, and it exclusively deals with errors in law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A party can appeal for a judicial review to the High Court on any issue of law that arises from the award, either: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A. With the agreement of all parties, or &lt;br&gt;
B. By obtaining leave of the Court, which is only granted if: “The decision on the legal issue could significantly impact the rights of one or more parties to the arbitration agreement” Section 1(3) and (4) of the 1979 Act.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Nema (1980) Case is an essential case in relation to judicial review, as it served as a “test case” for the application of Sections 1(3) and (4) of the Arbitration Act 1979. The Nema was chartered by its owners to charterers for seven consecutive voyages to Sorel in Canada. However, after one round voyage, the Nema arrived back at Sorrel but was unable to load due to a strike. The owners were permitted by the terms of the charter parties to take the Nema on one transatlantic voyage and decided to take her to Spain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The primary issue between the parties was whether the Nema was bound to proceed from Spain to Sorrel and wait there until the strike ended or the open water season ended, or whether their obligations had ended due to frustration, as the owners argued. The parties agreed to arbitration by a single arbitrator who concluded that the entire charter party, except for non-performance, was not frustrated. However, on appeal to the court, leave was granted for a judicial review of the arbitration award, and it was ruled that the charter party was frustrated. The Court of Appeal later overturned this decision, leading the charterers to appeal to the House of Lords.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The House of Lords held:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The High Court should not have granted leave to appeal on the decision of the arbitrator, nor should leave have been given to appeal to the Court of Appeal.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The arbitrator rightly concluded that the whole charter party, except for non-performance, was not frustrated.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regarding ‘one-off’ contracts, Parker J. stated that, unless there were special circumstances, leave should not be granted unless the court had formed a provisional view that the arbitrator was incorrect and would require significant convincing to believe otherwise, as seen in The Kerman (1982) case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lord Diplock emphasized that if the matter was of general interest to the commercial community, an authoritative ruling from the court would be beneficial in establishing certainty and predictability. He further noted that in a one-off contract, it was not necessarily evidence that the decision of an experienced arbitrator, chosen by the parties for their expertise in the trade, was not preferable to that of a member of the House of Lords.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reasoned Awards&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;reasoned-awards&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#reasoned-awards&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A party has the right to receive an award that includes sufficient reasons for the court to conduct a judicial review. If an appeal is made to the court from the award, and the judge is unable to consider any question of law arising from the award, the judge may order the arbitrator to state the reasons for the award in sufficient detail or to supplement the reasons given in the award. However, the judge can only make such an order if either: (A) a party notified the arbitrator before the award was made that a reasoned award was required; or (B) there is some special reason why the such notice was not given, as stated in Section 1 (5) and (6) of the 1979 Act.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This right of appeal is now limited to preventing abuse, which was previously common under the old ‘special case’ procedure. This procedure involved the High Court deciding on questions of ‘pure law’ that were referred to it as a ‘special case’, which set out the facts and the point of law upon which the court’s opinion was needed. However, the court would not decide the question of fact, as it was still the arbitrator’s responsibility to determine. This system of stating special cases received criticism for being a delaying tactic that could provide an advantage, such as from a changing exchange rate. This procedure was available under Section 21 of the 1950 Act but is now only possible for arbitration agreements made before the Arbitration Act 1979 came into force, i.e., pre-August 1979 arbitration agreements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Preliminary Points of Law&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Section 2 of the Arbitration Act 1979 provides for preliminary points of law to be referred to the High Court, which must be resolved before the arbitration award can be made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Further Appeals&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In legal matters, the High Court’s decisions may be appealed to the Court of Appeal, as per Section 1(7). However, such an appeal is only permitted if it concerns a matter of significant public interest. It’s noteworthy that there is no provision for any additional appeal to the House of Lords beyond this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exclusions of Judicial Review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In certain circumstances, the parties to arbitration may lawfully exclude any form of judicial review entirely. In such cases, even an appeal based on a point of law is not permitted, and the court is bereft of any authority to decide a preliminary point of law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the purposes of exclusion clauses, arbitrations are categorized as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A. Domestic arbitrations &lt;br&gt;
B. Non-Domestic arbitrations &lt;br&gt;
C. Special Category arbitrations&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An arbitration agreement is classified as domestic if, at the commencement of the proceedings:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It does not explicitly or implicitly provide for arbitration in a state other than the United Kingdom, and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All parties to the arbitration agreement are:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2a- Citizens of the United Kingdom or natural persons who habitually reside in the United Kingdom, or &lt;br&gt;
2b- Corporations incorporated in the United Kingdom or having their central management and control exercised in the United Kingdom [Section 1(4) of the Arbitration Act 1975].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is essential to note that this definition of a domestic arbitration agreement is relevant for several issues in the arbitration procedure. However, for the purposes of judicial review, the above requirement must be satisfied when the arbitration agreement is entered into, not at the commencement of the arbitration proceedings [Section 3(7) of the 1979 Act].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Special category proceedings refer to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a- A question or claim falling within the Admiralty jurisdiction of the High Court; or, &lt;br&gt;
b- A dispute arising from a contract of insurance; or, &lt;br&gt;
c- A dispute arising from a commodity contract [Section 4(1) of the 1979 Act].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Civil Jurisdiction and Judgements Act 1982 and Ship Chartering Disputes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;civil-jurisdiction-and-judgements-act-1982-and-ship-chartering-disputes&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#civil-jurisdiction-and-judgements-act-1982-and-ship-chartering-disputes&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rules for serving legal documents to individuals outside the jurisdiction are determined by whether the defendant is a member of a Contracting State under the 1968 Brussels Convention (also known as The Convention on Jurisdiction and Enforcement of Judgments in Civil and Commercial Matters). This Convention is made legally binding in England by the Civil Jurisdiction and Judgments Act 1982.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Convention’s applicability is governed by Article I, which states that it applies to “civil and commercial matters.” In essence, if a dispute falls within the Convention’s scope, and the intended defendant is “domiciled” in a Contracting State, the general rule is that they must be sued in the courts of their domicile state (unless there is a specific Convention provision allowing them to be sued elsewhere). However, Article I specifically excludes certain matters from the Convention’s scope, with arbitration being one of the excluded matters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What was the effect of the Nema v. ACRN Containers (1982) Case on arbitrations?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;what-was-the-effect-of-thenema-v-acrn-containers-1982case-on-arbitrations&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#what-was-the-effect-of-thenema-v-acrn-containers-1982case-on-arbitrations&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Nema v. ACRN Containers (1982) case had a significant effect on arbitrations, particularly in the UK and other common law jurisdictions. The key implications of the case for arbitrations include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;**Limited judicial intervention: **The Nema case established a high threshold for courts to intervene in arbitration awards, known as the “Nema test” or the “Nema guidelines.” According to this test, courts should only interfere with an arbitration award if the arbitrator has misdirected himself in law, or if the decision is so unreasonable that no reasonable arbitrator could have reached it. This principle has led to limited judicial intervention in arbitration awards, emphasizing the autonomy of arbitration proceedings.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;**Reinforcing the finality of arbitration awards: **By setting a high bar for judicial intervention, the Nema case reinforced the finality of arbitration awards. This has allowed parties to rely on arbitration as a means of dispute resolution with greater confidence, knowing that courts will respect the arbitrator’s decisions except in cases of clear legal error or patent unreasonableness.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Respect for party autonomy:&lt;/strong&gt; The Nema case demonstrates respect for party autonomy in the arbitration process. By limiting judicial intervention, the case ensures that parties who choose arbitration as their preferred method of dispute resolution can do so without fear of excessive judicial interference. This encourages parties to select arbitration as an alternative to litigation, especially in international disputes where neutrality and enforceability are important considerations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;**Influence on other common law jurisdictions: **The Nema test has been influential in other common law jurisdictions, leading to similar principles being adopted in various countries. This has contributed to a broader trend of respecting the parties’ choice to resolve their disputes through arbitration and has bolstered the confidence of parties in the arbitration process across multiple jurisdictions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In summary, the Nema v. ACRN Containers (1982) case has had a significant impact on arbitrations by limiting judicial intervention, reinforcing the finality of arbitration awards, respecting party autonomy, and influencing other common law jurisdictions to adopt similar principles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What effect has the 1968 Brussels Convention on arbitrations?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;what-effect-has-the-1968-brussels-convention-on-arbitrations&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#what-effect-has-the-1968-brussels-convention-on-arbitrations&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 1968 Brussels Convention, formally known as the Convention on Jurisdiction and the Enforcement of Judgments in Civil and Commercial Matters does not directly address arbitrations. However, its principles and provisions have had some indirect effects on the arbitration landscape in Europe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main purpose of the 1968 Brussels Convention was to create a uniform set of rules governing jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters among the contracting states, which were initially members of the European Economic Community (EEC). The convention aimed to facilitate cross-border trade and cooperation within the EEC by providing legal certainty and predictability in these areas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the 1968 Brussels Convention does not directly regulate arbitration, it has had some implications for arbitration in the following ways:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;**Exclusion of arbitration from the scope of the convention: **Article 1(4) of the Brussels Convention expressly excludes arbitration from its scope. This means that the rules on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments under the convention do not apply to arbitration proceedings or arbitral awards. As a result, the Brussels Convention has not directly harmonized or regulated arbitration among the contracting states, leaving room for other instruments, such as the 1958 New York Convention, to govern arbitration-related matters.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;**Relationship with arbitration agreements: **The Brussels Convention includes rules on jurisdiction, which determine which courts have the power to hear a particular dispute. This may have an indirect effect on arbitration, as parties may choose to include arbitration clauses in their contracts to avoid certain jurisdictional rules under the convention. In this sense, the Brussels Convention may have contributed to the use of arbitration as a means of dispute resolution in cross-border transactions within the EEC.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 1968 Brussels Convention does not directly address or regulate arbitrations. However, its provisions on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments have had indirect implications for the use of arbitration as a means of dispute resolution within the EEC. The exclusion of arbitration from the scope of the convention has left room for other instruments, such as the 1958 New York Convention, to govern arbitration-related matters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are the LMAA terms and procedures?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;what-are-the-lmaa-terms-and-procedures&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#what-are-the-lmaa-terms-and-procedures&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The LMAA, or London Maritime Arbitrators Association, is a leading international organization specializing in maritime arbitration. It consists of experienced maritime arbitrators who handle a wide range of shipping and maritime disputes. The LMAA provides a set of terms and procedures designed to govern and facilitate maritime arbitration proceedings conducted under its auspices. The LMAA periodically updates these terms to reflect best practices in maritime arbitration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The LMAA Terms and Procedures consist of the following primary components:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LMAA (London Maritime Arbitrators Association) Terms:&lt;/strong&gt; The LMAA Terms set out the procedural framework for arbitration proceedings conducted under the LMAA. They address various aspects of the arbitration process, such as the appointment of arbitrators, communications, procedural directions, submissions, hearings, awards, and costs. The LMAA Terms are designed to be flexible and efficient, providing parties and arbitrators with the ability to tailor the arbitration process to the specific needs of their dispute.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LMAA (London Maritime Arbitrators Association) Small Claims Procedure:&lt;/strong&gt; The LMAA Small Claims Procedure is designed for the resolution of lower-value disputes, typically involving claims of USD 100,000 or less. This procedure offers a streamlined and cost-effective alternative to the full LMAA Terms, with shorter timeframes, simplified procedures, and restrictions on recoverable costs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LMAA (London Maritime Arbitrators Association) Intermediate Claims Procedure:&lt;/strong&gt; The LMAA Intermediate Claims Procedure is intended for disputes of a moderate value or complexity, typically involving claims between USD 100,000 and USD 400,000. This procedure offers a more streamlined process than the full LMAA Terms but with greater procedural flexibility than the Small Claims Procedure. It is designed to strike a balance between efficiency and procedural safeguards for parties in medium-sized disputes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;**LMAA(London Maritime Arbitrators Association) Guidelines: **The LMAA also provides guidelines to assist parties and arbitrators in conducting arbitrations under its terms and procedures. These guidelines cover various topics, such as arbitrator appointments, procedural orders, electronic communications, document production, and costs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By providing a flexible and efficient framework for maritime arbitration, the LMAA Terms and Procedures promote the fair and expeditious resolution of shipping and maritime disputes. The LMAA’s specialized procedures for small and intermediate claims further cater to the needs of parties in lower-value and medium-sized disputes, offering tailored processes to minimize costs and streamline the resolution of such matters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is the arbitration clause of the LMAA?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;what-is-the-arbitration-clause-of-the-lmaa&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#what-is-the-arbitration-clause-of-the-lmaa&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The London Maritime Arbitrators Association (LMAA) does not provide a specific, standardized arbitration clause to be used in contracts. Instead, parties are free to draft their own arbitration clause, specifying that any disputes arising out of the contract will be resolved through arbitration under the LMAA Terms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When drafting an arbitration clause referring to LMAA arbitration, it is essential to include certain key elements to ensure the clause is effective and enforceable. Here is a sample arbitration clause that incorporates LMAA arbitration:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Any dispute arising out of or in connection with this contract, including any question regarding its existence, validity, or termination, shall be referred to and finally resolved by arbitration in London, England, in accordance with the London Maritime Arbitrators Association (LMAA) Terms current at the time when the arbitration proceedings are commenced. The reference shall be to three arbitrators, with each party having the right to appoint one arbitrator and the two party-appointed arbitrators selecting the third arbitrator. The language of the arbitration shall be English.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This sample clause addresses several crucial aspects, including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The scope of disputes to be submitted to arbitration (covering any disputes arising out of or in connection with the contract).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The reference to the LMAA Terms, which will govern the arbitration proceedings.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The seat of arbitration (London, England) and the number of arbitrators (three).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The process for the appointment of arbitrators (each party appoints one arbitrator, and the two party-appointed arbitrators select the third).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The language of the arbitration (English).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is important to note that this is just a sample clause, and the specific language of an arbitration clause should be tailored to the needs of the parties and the particular contract. Parties may also wish to seek legal advice when drafting an arbitration clause to ensure that it is valid and enforceable under the applicable laws.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is Maritime Arbitration in simple words?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;what-is-maritime-arbitration-in-simple-words&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#what-is-maritime-arbitration-in-simple-words&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maritime arbitration, in simple words, is a process of resolving disputes related to shipping, maritime, and other ocean-related matters through arbitration instead of going to court. Arbitration is a form of alternative dispute resolution where an impartial person or a panel of experts, called arbitrators, makes a binding decision after listening to the parties’ arguments and reviewing the evidence. In maritime arbitration, the arbitrators typically have specialized knowledge and experience in the maritime industry, which helps them better understand the specific issues and complexities involved in maritime disputes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is LMAA Intermediate Claims Procedure 2021?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;what-is-lmaa-intermediate-claims-procedure-2021&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#what-is-lmaa-intermediate-claims-procedure-2021&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The LMAA Intermediate Claims Procedure 2021 is a set of procedural rules developed by the London Maritime Arbitrators Association (LMAA) for handling maritime disputes of moderate value or complexity. This procedure is intended for cases where the amount in dispute is generally between USD 100,000 and USD 400,000, although parties can agree to use it for disputes of other values as well. The Intermediate Claims Procedure offers a more streamlined process compared to the full LMAA Terms but with greater procedural flexibility than the LMAA Small Claims Procedure. It is designed to strike a balance between efficiency and procedural safeguards for parties in medium-sized disputes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some key features of the LMAA Intermediate Claims Procedure 2021 include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;**Appointment of a Sole Arbitrator: **The Intermediate Claims Procedure is designed for cases with a sole arbitrator, who is appointed by the parties or, if they cannot agree, by the LMAA President.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;**Expedited Procedures: **The procedure sets specific time limits for submitting statements of claim and defense, as well as for any subsequent submissions, in order to streamline the arbitration process and expedite the resolution of disputes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;**Limited Discovery: **The procedure encourages limited document production, with parties expected to provide only the documents they consider relevant and material to their case, minimizing the time and cost associated with extensive document discovery.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;**Hearings and Procedure: **Hearings are not held as a matter of course but may be requested by either party or directed by the arbitrator if deemed necessary. The arbitrator has the authority to determine the procedure for such hearings, including the examination of witnesses and the presentation of evidence.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;**Awards and Costs: **The arbitrator is required to render a final award within a specified time period following the conclusion of the proceedings. The procedure also contains provisions relating to the allocation of costs between the parties, with a focus on proportionality and reasonableness.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The LMAA Intermediate Claims Procedure 2021 provides parties with a more efficient and cost-effective option for resolving moderate value or complexity disputes in the maritime industry while maintaining the procedural fairness and integrity of the arbitration process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are the 4 types of dispute resolution in shipping?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;what-are-the-4-types-of-dispute-resolution-in-shipping&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#what-are-the-4-types-of-dispute-resolution-in-shipping&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the shipping industry, disputes can arise from various aspects of maritime transactions and operations, such as charter parties, bills of lading, shipbuilding contracts, and insurance policies. To resolve these disputes, parties often resort to one of the following four main types of dispute resolution methods:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;**Negotiation: **Negotiation is the most straightforward and informal method of dispute resolution. Parties involved in a shipping dispute communicate directly with each other to discuss their differences and attempt to reach a mutually acceptable solution. Negotiation can be a quick and cost-effective way to resolve disputes, as it does not involve any third-party intervention or formal procedures.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mediation:&lt;/strong&gt; Mediation is a voluntary, non-binding process where a neutral third party, called a mediator, helps the disputing parties to reach a mutually acceptable resolution. The mediator facilitates communication between the parties, assists them in identifying their interests and needs, and explores possible solutions. Mediation can be a more efficient and cost-effective alternative to litigation or arbitration, as it often results in a quicker resolution and fosters better relationships between the parties.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;**Arbitration: **Arbitration is a private and binding method of dispute resolution where an impartial person or a panel of experts, called arbitrators, is appointed by the parties or an arbitration institution to hear their case and render a final decision, known as an arbitral award. In the shipping industry, specialized arbitration institutions, such as the London Maritime Arbitrators Association (LMAA) and the Society of Maritime Arbitrators (SMA), handle maritime disputes. Arbitration can be more efficient and flexible than litigation, as the parties can choose the arbitrators, the procedural rules, and the applicable law.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;**Litigation: **Litigation is the process of resolving disputes through the court system. Parties involved in a shipping dispute may choose to file a lawsuit in a court with jurisdiction over the matter. The court will then hear the case, examine the evidence, and render a judgment that is binding on the parties. Litigation can be time-consuming and costly, but it may be necessary in certain situations, such as when a party seeks a judicial determination on a point of law or when other methods of dispute resolution have been unsuccessful.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each of these dispute resolution methods has its advantages and disadvantages, and the appropriate method depends on factors such as the nature of the dispute, the parties’ preferences, the potential costs and time involved, and the desired outcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are the Society of Maritime Arbitrators (SMA) terms and procedures?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;what-are-the-society-of-maritime-arbitrators-sma-terms-and-procedures&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#what-are-the-society-of-maritime-arbitrators-sma-terms-and-procedures&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Society of Maritime Arbitrators (SMA) is a leading maritime arbitration organization based in New York City. The SMA is composed of experienced maritime professionals who serve as arbitrators in various shipping and maritime disputes. The SMA provides a set of rules and procedures that govern arbitrations conducted under its auspices, known as the SMA Rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SMA Rules are designed to offer a flexible, efficient, and fair framework for maritime arbitration. They address various aspects of the arbitration process, such as the appointment of arbitrators, communications, pleadings, hearings, awards, and costs. Some key features of the SMA Rules include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;**Appointment of Arbitrators: **The SMA Rules provide guidance on the appointment of arbitrators, including the number of arbitrators, the appointment process, and the qualifications of arbitrators. In most cases, a panel of three arbitrators is appointed, with each party appointing one arbitrator, and the two party-appointed arbitrators selecting the third.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;**Communications and Case Management: **The SMA Rules outline procedures for communications between the parties, their representatives, and the arbitrators. They also provide for the use of case management techniques to streamline the arbitration process and encourage the efficient resolution of disputes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;**Pleadings and Evidence: **The SMA Rules set out requirements for the submission of pleadings, such as statements of claim and defense, as well as the submission of evidence, including witness statements, expert reports, and documentary evidence.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;**Hearings and Procedure: **The SMA Rules provide for hearings to be held at the discretion of the arbitrators, and they allow the arbitrators to determine the procedure for such hearings, including the examination of witnesses and the presentation of evidence.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;**Awards and Costs: **The SMA Rules address the issuance of awards, including the form and content of the awards, and they provide guidance on the allocation of costs between the parties.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Interim Measures and Security for Claims:&lt;/strong&gt; The SMA Rules allow arbitrators to grant interim measures and order security for claims or costs, as appropriate in the circumstances of the case.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By providing a flexible and efficient framework for maritime arbitration, the SMA Rules promote the fair and expeditious resolution of shipping and maritime disputes. The SMA’s focus on case management and procedural efficiency helps minimize the time and costs associated with the arbitration process while maintaining a high standard of fairness and procedural integrity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Which jurisdiction is the best for maritime dispute resolution?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;which-jurisdiction-is-the-best-for-maritime-dispute-resolution&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#which-jurisdiction-is-the-best-for-maritime-dispute-resolution&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There isn’t a universally “best” jurisdiction for maritime dispute resolution, as the most suitable jurisdiction depends on various factors such as the nature of the dispute, the parties involved, the applicable law, and the desired outcome. However, some jurisdictions are well-known for their maritime expertise, established legal frameworks, and specialized arbitration institutions, making them popular choices for resolving maritime disputes. Some of these jurisdictions include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;**England (London): **London is a leading center for maritime dispute resolution, primarily due to its long history as a global shipping hub, its well-developed maritime legal framework, and the presence of the London Maritime Arbitrators Association (LMAA). English law is often chosen as the governing law in maritime contracts, and English courts and LMAA arbitrators have extensive experience handling maritime disputes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;**United States (New York): **New York is another major center for maritime dispute resolution, particularly for disputes involving parties from the Americas. The Society of Maritime Arbitrators (SMA) is a well-respected arbitration institution based in New York that specializes in handling maritime disputes. Additionally, U.S. federal courts, particularly those in New York, have extensive experience in handling maritime cases under U.S. maritime law.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Singapore:&lt;/strong&gt; Singapore has emerged as a leading maritime dispute resolution center in Asia, thanks to its strategic location, its well-developed legal infrastructure, and its efforts to promote itself as a hub for international arbitration. The Singapore Chamber of Maritime Arbitration (SCMA) offers specialized arbitration services for maritime disputes, and Singaporean courts have a strong reputation for their expertise in maritime law.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;**Hong Kong: **Hong Kong is another prominent maritime dispute resolution center in Asia. Its well-developed legal system, based on English common law, and its status as a major shipping and trading hub make it an attractive jurisdiction for maritime disputes. The Hong Kong International Arbitration Centre (HKIAC) offers specialized arbitration services for maritime disputes, and Hong Kong courts have extensive experience in handling maritime cases.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Factors to consider when choosing a jurisdiction include the applicable law, the efficiency and expertise of the courts or arbitration institutions, the enforceability of judgments or arbitral awards, and the costs involved in pursuing a dispute in that jurisdiction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is the best form of dispute resolution in ship chartering? and What are the dispute resolution clauses in Charterparties?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;what-is-the-best-form-of-dispute-resolution-in-ship-chartering-andwhat-are-the-dispute-resolution-clauses-in-charterparties&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#what-is-the-best-form-of-dispute-resolution-in-ship-chartering-andwhat-are-the-dispute-resolution-clauses-in-charterparties&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There isn’t a one-size-fits-all “best” form of dispute resolution for ship chartering, as the most suitable method depends on various factors, such as the nature and complexity of the dispute, the relationship between the parties, the potential costs, and the desired outcome. However, some common methods of dispute resolution used in ship chartering include negotiation, mediation, arbitration, and litigation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Negotiation:&lt;/strong&gt; Negotiation can be the quickest and least expensive method of dispute resolution. It involves direct communication between the parties to reach a mutually acceptable solution. It is often the first step in resolving disputes and can be effective when the parties are cooperative and open to compromise.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;**Mediation: **Mediation involves a neutral third party, called a mediator, who facilitates communication between the parties and assists them in finding a mutually agreeable solution. Mediation can be cost-effective and efficient, and it can help preserve business relationships. It is particularly useful when parties have an ongoing relationship and are willing to collaborate to find a solution.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Arbitration:&lt;/strong&gt; Arbitration is a private, binding process where a neutral third party or a panel of experts, called arbitrators, hears the case and renders a final decision. Arbitration is often favored in the shipping industry because it allows for the appointment of arbitrators with specialized maritime knowledge, offers a more flexible and confidential process, and is generally faster and less expensive than litigation. Institutions like the London Maritime Arbitrators Association (LMAA) and the Society of Maritime Arbitrators (SMA) specialize in maritime arbitration and offer tailored rules and procedures for handling ship chartering disputes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;**Litigation: **Litigation involves resolving disputes through the court system, and it can be time-consuming, expensive, and public. In some cases, litigation may be necessary, such as when a party requires a judicial determination on a point of law or when other methods of dispute resolution have failed. However, it is generally considered a last resort in ship chartering disputes due to its drawbacks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When choosing the most suitable method of dispute resolution for ship chartering, parties should consider the specific circumstances of their case and consult with legal counsel to determine the most appropriate approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is the effect of a Scott v Avery Clause?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;what-is-the-effect-of-a-scott-v-avery-clause&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#what-is-the-effect-of-a-scott-v-avery-clause&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Scott v Avery clause, named after the English case Scott v Avery (1856), is a provision commonly found in commercial contracts, including maritime agreements, that requires parties to resolve their disputes through arbitration or another alternative dispute resolution (ADR) mechanism before they can initiate legal proceedings in court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The effect of a Scott v Avery clause is to make arbitration or the chosen ADR method a condition precedent to litigation, meaning that parties must first exhaust the specified dispute resolution process before resorting to court action. If a party ignores the clause and directly files a lawsuit, the court will likely stay or dismiss the legal proceedings, requiring the parties to abide by the arbitration or ADR process specified in the contract.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The benefits of a Scott v Avery clause include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Encouraging parties to resolve their disputes privately and without resorting to litigation, which can be costly and time-consuming.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Allowing parties to choose their dispute resolution method, such as arbitration, where they can select arbitrators with specialized knowledge in the relevant field and maintain the confidentiality of the proceedings.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Providing a streamlined and efficient process for resolving disputes, which can help preserve business relationships between the parties.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is essential for parties to draft the Scott v Avery clause clearly and unambiguously to ensure that it is enforceable and effectively guides the parties through the designated dispute resolution process before they can initiate legal proceedings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;**Why would shipowners and charterers choose to go to arbitration rather than court? **&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;why-would-shipowners-and-charterers-choose-to-go-to-arbitration-rather-than-court&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#why-would-shipowners-and-charterers-choose-to-go-to-arbitration-rather-than-court&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shipowners and charterers often choose arbitration over court litigation for resolving disputes for several reasons:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;**Expertise: **Arbitration allows parties to appoint arbitrators with specialized knowledge and experience in the maritime industry. This expertise enables arbitrators to better understand the complexities and technicalities of maritime disputes, which may lead to more informed and accurate decisions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;**Flexibility: **Arbitration offers parties greater control over the dispute resolution process, such as choosing the procedural rules, the applicable law, the language of the proceedings, and the location of the arbitration. This flexibility can make the process more efficient and better suited to the parties’ specific needs and circumstances.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;**Confidentiality: **Arbitration proceedings are generally private and confidential, which can be particularly valuable for shipowners and charterers who wish to avoid the publicity associated with court litigation. Confidentiality can help protect sensitive commercial information and maintain the reputation of the parties involved.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;**Enforceability: **Arbitral awards are generally more straightforward to enforce internationally than court judgments, thanks to the New York Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards. This convention, which has been ratified by more than 160 countries, facilitates the recognition and enforcement of arbitral awards across borders, making it easier for successful parties to recover their claims.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;**Finality: **Arbitration usually provides for limited grounds for challenging or appealing an arbitral award, resulting in a quicker resolution of disputes compared to court litigation, which often involves multiple levels of appeal.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Preservation of relationships:&lt;/strong&gt; Arbitration, being a less adversarial process than court litigation, can help preserve commercial relationships between shipowners and charterers by focusing on a mutually agreeable resolution and reducing the potential for long-lasting disputes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shipowners and charterers may choose arbitration over court litigation due to the benefits of expertise, flexibility, confidentiality, enforceability, finality, and preservation of relationships. However, the suitability of arbitration depends on the specific circumstances of the dispute and the preferences of the parties involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are the different types of maritime dispute resolution offered by the London and New York Associations?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;what-are-the-different-types-of-maritime-dispute-resolution-offered-by-the-london-and-new-york-associations&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#what-are-the-different-types-of-maritime-dispute-resolution-offered-by-the-london-and-new-york-associations&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The London and New York Associations, namely the London Maritime Arbitrators Association (LMAA) and the Society of Maritime Arbitrators (SMA), are two well-respected institutions specializing in maritime dispute resolution. Both associations offer a range of arbitration procedures tailored to the specific needs of parties involved in shipping disputes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;London Maritime Arbitrators Association (LMAA):&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;**LMAA Terms: **The LMAA Terms provide a comprehensive framework for maritime arbitration in London, outlining the rules and procedures to be followed by arbitrators and parties throughout the process. The LMAA Terms are designed for disputes of varying complexity and monetary value.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;**LMAA Intermediate Claims Procedure: **This procedure is intended for cases where the amount in dispute is generally between USD 100,000 and USD 400,000, although parties can agree to use it for disputes of other values. It offers a more streamlined process compared to the full LMAA Terms but provides greater procedural flexibility than the LMAA Small Claims Procedure.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LMAA Small Claims Procedure:&lt;/strong&gt; Designed for disputes with a value not exceeding USD 100,000 or an equivalent amount in another currency, this procedure offers a fast and cost-effective method for resolving lower-value maritime disputes. The process involves a sole arbitrator, and hearings are generally not held.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Society of Maritime Arbitrators (SMA):&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;**SMA Rules: **The SMA Rules provide a comprehensive framework for maritime arbitration in New York, setting out the procedures and guidelines for the arbitration process. Like the LMAA Terms, the SMA Rules are designed for disputes of varying complexity and monetary value.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;**SMA Shortened Arbitration Procedure: **This procedure offers an expedited arbitration process for disputes where the parties desire a quicker resolution. It involves a sole arbitrator, and the time limits for submissions and the rendering of the award are shortened.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SMA Mediation Rules:&lt;/strong&gt; In addition to arbitration, the SMA provides mediation services to help parties resolve their disputes amicably. Mediation is a voluntary, non-binding process in which a neutral third party (the mediator) facilitates communication between the parties and assists them in finding a mutually acceptable resolution.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both the LMAA and SMA offer tailored dispute resolution processes that cater to the specific needs of parties involved in maritime disputes. The choice between these institutions and their procedures will depend on the parties’ preferences, the nature and value of the dispute, and the desired outcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Explain the use of Arbitration in the Settlement of Ship Chartering Disputes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;explain-the-use-of-arbitration-in-the-settlement-of-ship-chartering-disputes&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#explain-the-use-of-arbitration-in-the-settlement-of-ship-chartering-disputes&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Arbitration is a widely used method for resolving ship chartering disputes. In arbitration, parties involved in a dispute refer the matter to an impartial third party or a panel of experts (arbitrators) who review the case, consider the evidence, and make a binding decision called an arbitral award. Here are some key aspects of using arbitration in the settlement of ship chartering disputes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;**Contractual basis: **Parties typically include an arbitration clause in their ship charter agreements, which specifies the arbitration procedure, the choice of arbitral institution, and the governing law. The arbitration clause serves as the basis for the parties’ agreement to resolve any disputes arising from the charter through arbitration rather than court litigation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;**Selection of arbitrators: **In arbitration, parties can choose arbitrators with specialized knowledge and experience in the maritime industry. This expertise enables arbitrators to better understand the complexities and technicalities of ship chartering disputes, which may lead to more informed and accurate decisions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Procedural flexibility:&lt;/strong&gt; Arbitration offers greater control over the dispute resolution process, as parties can choose the procedural rules, the applicable law, the language of the proceedings, and the location of the arbitration. This flexibility allows the process to be tailored to the specific needs and circumstances of the ship chartering dispute.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;**Confidentiality: **Arbitration proceedings are generally private and confidential, which can be particularly valuable for parties in ship chartering disputes who wish to avoid the publicity associated with court litigation. Confidentiality can help protect sensitive commercial information and maintain the reputation of the parties involved.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;**Enforceability: **Arbitral awards are usually easier to enforce internationally than court judgments, thanks to the New York Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards. The convention has been ratified by more than 160 countries, which simplifies the recognition and enforcement of arbitral awards across borders, making it easier for successful parties to recover their claims.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;**Finality: **Arbitration typically provides for limited grounds for challenging or appealing an arbitral award, resulting in a quicker resolution of disputes compared to court litigation, which often involves multiple levels of appeal.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arbitration is a popular method for resolving ship chartering disputes due to its advantages in expertise, flexibility, confidentiality, enforceability, and finality. The use of arbitration can lead to more efficient, cost-effective, and satisfactory outcomes for parties involved in ship chartering disputes compared to traditional court litigation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are the main Charter Party Disputes?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;what-are-the-main-charter-party-disputes&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#what-are-the-main-charter-party-disputes&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Charter party disputes can arise from various issues in the context of a ship charter agreement, which is a contract between a shipowner and a charterer for the use of a vessel for the transportation of goods or passengers. Some of the main charter party disputes include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;**Payment disputes: **Disputes may arise over the payment of charter hire, demurrage, or other fees agreed upon in the contract. These disputes can be triggered by disagreements over the calculation of amounts due, late payments, or non-payments.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;**Off-hire disputes: **Off-hire disputes involve disagreements about whether and when the vessel is considered “off-hire” and not earning hire payments. These disputes can arise from differing interpretations of off-hire clauses or disagreements about whether certain events or conditions qualify as off-hire events.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Laytime and demurrage disputes:&lt;/strong&gt; Disputes may arise over the calculation of laytime (the time allowed for loading and unloading cargo) and demurrage (the fees charged for exceeding the allowed laytime). These disputes often result from disagreements about when laytime begins, what constitutes “time used,” and whether certain events justify an extension of laytime or suspension of demurrage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;**Cargo disputes: **Cargo-related disputes can arise from issues like cargo damage or loss, contamination, or misdeclaration of cargo. These disputes often involve determining the responsible party and assessing liability for the cargo issues.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ship performance disputes:&lt;/strong&gt; These disputes arise when the vessel’s performance, such as speed or fuel consumption, does not meet the agreed-upon specifications in the charter party. These disputes may involve assessing the vessel’s performance, determining the extent of any deviation from the contract, and calculating any damages or compensation owed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;**Bunker disputes: **Bunker disputes relate to the quality, quantity, or delivery of fuel for the vessel. They can arise from disagreements about bunker prices, payment terms, or claims of contaminated or off-specification fuel.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Safe port/berth disputes:&lt;/strong&gt; These disputes arise when a charterer nominates a port or berth that turns out to be unsafe for the vessel, resulting in damages or delays. In such cases, the parties may disagree on whether the port or berth was unsafe, whether the charterer was aware of the risk, and the allocation of liability for any resulting losses.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;**Deviation disputes: **Deviation disputes arise when a vessel deviates from its agreed route, causing delays or additional costs. These disputes often involve determining whether the deviation was justified, assessing the impact on the voyage, and calculating any damages or compensation owed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The nature and complexity of charter party disputes can vary widely depending on the specific circumstances of each case. Resolving these disputes often requires specialized knowledge of maritime law and industry practices, which is why arbitration and other alternative dispute resolution methods are commonly used in the shipping industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Effects of Charter Party Arbitration Clauses&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;effects-of-charter-party-arbitration-clauses&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#effects-of-charter-party-arbitration-clauses&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Charter party arbitration clauses play a crucial role in the resolution of disputes arising from ship charter agreements. These clauses outline the agreed-upon process for resolving disputes through arbitration rather than court litigation. The effects of charter party arbitration clauses include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;**Selection of dispute resolution method: **The arbitration clause establishes arbitration as the preferred method of dispute resolution for the parties, ensuring that any disputes arising from the charter party will be referred to arbitration rather than being litigated in court.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Choice of arbitrators:&lt;/strong&gt; The arbitration clause often allows parties to select arbitrators with specialized knowledge and experience in the maritime industry, ensuring that the dispute resolution process is overseen by experts who understand the complexities and technicalities of the shipping sector.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;**Procedural framework: **The arbitration clause typically sets out the procedural framework for the arbitration, including the choice of arbitral institution, rules governing the proceedings, the applicable law, the language of the arbitration, and the place of arbitration. This framework provides parties with greater control over the dispute resolution process and ensures that the arbitration is tailored to their specific needs and circumstances.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;**Confidentiality: **By opting for arbitration through the arbitration clause, parties can maintain the confidentiality of the dispute resolution process, as arbitration proceedings are generally private and confidential. This can be particularly important for preserving sensitive commercial information and protecting the reputation of the parties involved.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enforceability of arbitral awards:&lt;/strong&gt; Arbitration clauses facilitate the recognition and enforcement of arbitral awards, as they are generally more straightforward to enforce internationally than court judgments due to the New York Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards. This convention has been ratified by more than 160 countries, making it easier for successful parties to recover their claims across borders.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;**Finality of the process: **Arbitration clauses generally provide for limited grounds for challenging or appealing an arbitral award, which promotes the finality of the arbitration process and results in quicker resolution of disputes compared to court litigation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;**Preservation of commercial relationships: **Arbitration clauses encourage the resolution of disputes through a less adversarial process than court litigation, which can help preserve commercial relationships between shipowners and charterers by focusing on a mutually agreeable resolution and reducing the potential for long-lasting disputes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Charter party arbitration clauses have several effects on the dispute resolution process, including establishing arbitration as the preferred method of dispute resolution, providing a procedural framework, ensuring confidentiality, facilitating enforceability, promoting finality, and preserving commercial relationships.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What principal changes have the Arbitration Act 1996 made to the arbitral process?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;what-principal-changes-have-the-arbitration-act-1996-made-to-the-arbitral-process&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#what-principal-changes-have-the-arbitration-act-1996-made-to-the-arbitral-process&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Arbitration Act 1996 introduced several significant changes to the arbitral process in the UK. Some of the principal changes include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;**Modernization of the law: **The Act replaced the outdated Arbitration Act 1950 and brought UK law in line with international best practices. The Act provided a modern framework for arbitration, which increased the efficiency and effectiveness of the arbitral process.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Autonomy of the parties:&lt;/strong&gt; The Act recognized the principle of party autonomy in arbitration, which allows parties to agree on the procedure for resolving their disputes, including the choice of arbitrators, governing law, and procedural rules. This gave parties greater control over the arbitral process and allowed them to tailor the process to their specific needs and circumstances.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;**Streamlined court procedures: **The Act introduced a streamlined approach to court procedures, which reduced the need for court intervention in the arbitral process. The court’s role was limited to providing assistance and support to the arbitral process and enforcing arbitral awards.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;**Increased powers of the arbitrator: **The Act increased the powers of the arbitrator, allowing them to make orders for the attendance of witnesses, the production of documents, and the inspection of property. This gave the arbitrator greater control over the evidence-gathering process, which increased the efficiency and effectiveness of the arbitral process.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;**Simplified enforcement of arbitral awards: **The Act simplified the process for enforcing arbitral awards by allowing parties to enforce the award in the same way as a court judgment. This reduced the time and costs associated with enforcing awards and increased the finality of the arbitral process.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;**Confidentiality: **The Act introduced provisions to protect the confidentiality of the arbitral process, which increased the attractiveness of arbitration as a dispute resolution mechanism for parties who value privacy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Arbitration Act 1996 modernized the arbitral process in the UK, increased the autonomy of parties, and simplified court procedures. The Act gave arbitrators greater powers to manage the arbitral process, simplified the enforcement of arbitral awards, and provided provisions for protecting the confidentiality of the arbitral process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is Charter Party Dispute?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;what-is-charter-party-dispute&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#what-is-charter-party-dispute&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Charter Party dispute is a legal dispute arising out of a contract for the use of a vessel. A Charter Party is a contract between a shipowner and a charterer, in which the shipowner agrees to make their vessel available to the charterer for a specified period or voyage, in exchange for payment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Charter Party disputes can arise for a variety of reasons, including disputes over the terms of the contract, the condition of the vessel, the quality of the cargo, delays in delivery or performance, and disputes over payment or freight rates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Some common types of Charter Party disputes include:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;**Demurrage disputes: **These disputes arise when a vessel is delayed beyond the agreed-upon laytime for loading or unloading cargo, and the charterer is required to pay demurrage charges to the shipowner.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;**Off-hire disputes: **These disputes arise when a vessel becomes unavailable for use due to breakdowns or other reasons, and the charterer seeks to be relieved of their obligation to pay hire during the period of unavailability.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;**Cargo disputes: **These disputes can arise over the quality or quantity of cargo or issues related to the loading or discharge of the cargo.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Repairs and maintenance disputes: T&lt;/strong&gt;hese disputes arise over issues related to the condition of the vessel, such as disputes over the cost and responsibility for repairs and maintenance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Charter Party disputes can be complex and can involve a range of legal and commercial issues. They are typically resolved through arbitration, as the parties often prefer the confidentiality, flexibility, and specialized expertise of arbitration as a dispute resolution mechanism. Charter Party disputes are a common feature of the shipping industry, and they require careful attention to detail and a clear understanding of the legal and commercial issues involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is meant by a “Reasoned Award” in Maritime Arbitration?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;what-is-meant-by-a-reasoned-award-in-maritime-arbitration&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#what-is-meant-by-a-reasoned-award-in-maritime-arbitration&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A reasoned award in maritime arbitration refers to an arbitral award that contains a clear and detailed explanation of the arbitrator’s reasoning and findings. The arbitrator is required to provide a comprehensive and reasoned decision, explaining the basis for their decision on each of the issues presented in the dispute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reasoned award is important in maritime arbitration because it provides the parties with a clear understanding of how the arbitrator reached their decision. This can help to avoid confusion and disputes about the reasoning behind the decision and can facilitate compliance with the award.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, a reasoned award can assist the parties in any subsequent legal proceedings, such as an application to set aside or enforce the award. It can also provide guidance to future arbitrators on similar issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The content of a reasoned award may vary depending on the nature and complexity of the dispute. However, it generally includes a summary of the dispute, the applicable law, the issues presented, the evidence presented by the parties, the arbitrator’s findings, and the reasons for the decision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reasoned award is an essential element of the arbitral process in maritime disputes. It provides parties with a clear understanding of the basis for the decision and promotes transparency and consistency in the arbitration process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to choose an Arbitrator in Ship Chartering Dispute?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;how-to-choose-an-arbitrator-in-ship-chartering-dispute&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#how-to-choose-an-arbitrator-in-ship-chartering-dispute&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Choosing the right arbitrator is crucial for the successful resolution of a ship chartering dispute. Here are some factors to consider when selecting an arbitrator:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;**Expertise: **The arbitrator should have expertise in maritime law and specifically in ship chartering. They should be familiar with the legal and commercial aspects of the shipping industry and have experience in handling similar disputes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Impartiality:&lt;/strong&gt; The arbitrator should be impartial and not have any conflicts of interest that could affect their ability to make an unbiased decision. It is important to ensure that the arbitrator has no prior relationship with either party that could influence their decision.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;**Availability: **The arbitrator should be available to hear the case and should not have any conflicts that could delay the arbitration process. It is important to consider the arbitrator’s schedule and availability before selecting them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Location&lt;/strong&gt;: The arbitrator’s location should be convenient for both parties, and it should be easy to arrange the hearing at the chosen location. The location should also be a jurisdiction that is familiar with maritime law.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reputation: The arbitrator should have a good reputation for fairness and impartiality. Parties should consider the arbitrator’s previous experience and consult with industry peers and legal advisors to ensure that they have a good reputation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Language:&lt;/strong&gt; The arbitrator should be fluent in the language used in the arbitration, as this will facilitate the process and ensure that there are no misunderstandings.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cost:&lt;/strong&gt; Parties should consider the arbitrator’s fees and expenses, as well as any administrative costs associated with the arbitration.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to the above factors, parties should also consider the specific requirements of their dispute, such as the governing law, the complexity of the issues, and the need for technical expertise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, the goal is to select an arbitrator who is experienced, impartial, and available, and who has a good reputation for handling ship chartering disputes. By taking the time to carefully consider these factors, parties can increase their chances of a successful and satisfactory outcome to their dispute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another important factor to consider when choosing an arbitrator is the type of dispute resolution method that will be used. Arbitration institutions may offer different procedures and rules for the resolution of disputes, and parties should carefully consider these before selecting an arbitrator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, some arbitration institutions offer expedited procedures that can be more cost-effective and efficient for resolving smaller claims. Other institutions may offer more formal procedures with detailed rules and timelines for the resolution of disputes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parties should also consider whether they want a sole arbitrator or a panel of arbitrators to hear their dispute. A sole arbitrator may be more suitable for smaller disputes, while a panel may be necessary for more complex or high-value claims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When selecting an arbitrator, it is also important to consider the language of the arbitration. Parties should ensure that the arbitrator is fluent in the language used in the arbitration, as this will help to avoid misunderstandings and ensure that the proceedings run smoothly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, parties should ensure that they select an arbitrator who is familiar with the specific requirements of their dispute. For example, if the dispute involves a specific type of vessel or cargo, parties may wish to select an arbitrator who has experience in that area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Choosing an arbitrator for a ship chartering dispute requires careful consideration of a range of factors, including the arbitrator’s expertise, impartiality, availability, location, reputation, cost, and the type of dispute resolution method that will be used. By taking the time to carefully consider these factors, parties can increase their chances of a successful and satisfactory outcome to their dispute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are the three Problems Caused by Arbitration Clauses?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;what-are-the-three-problems-caused-by-arbitration-clauses&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#what-are-the-three-problems-caused-by-arbitration-clauses&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While arbitration clauses are commonly used in contracts to resolve disputes, they can also give rise to several problems, including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;**Lack of transparency: **The use of arbitration clauses can lead to a lack of transparency in the dispute resolution process. Unlike court proceedings, arbitration hearings are often private, and the arbitrator’s decision may not be made public. This can result in a lack of accountability and may undermine public trust in the fairness of the arbitration process.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;**Limited rights of appeal: **The use of arbitration clauses can also limit the parties’ rights of appeal. In many cases, the arbitrator’s decision is final and binding, and there may be limited options for appeal. This can be problematic if the arbitrator’s decision is perceived to be unfair or incorrect, and can result in parties being stuck with an unfavorable outcome.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;**Higher costs: **Arbitration can be more expensive than court proceedings, especially if the dispute involves complex technical issues or multiple parties. The parties are typically responsible for paying the fees and expenses of the arbitrator, as well as any administrative costs associated with the arbitration process. This can make arbitration prohibitive for some parties and may result in disputes being left unresolved.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, arbitration clauses can be difficult to enforce in certain jurisdictions, and the effectiveness of the arbitration process may be limited in cases where there is a significant power imbalance between the parties. While arbitration clauses can be a useful tool for resolving disputes, they can also give rise to several problems, including a lack of transparency, limited rights of appeal, and higher costs. It is important for parties to carefully consider these issues before including an arbitration clause in their contracts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) in Ship Chartering?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;what-is-alternative-dispute-resolution-adr-in-ship-chartering&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#what-is-alternative-dispute-resolution-adr-in-ship-chartering&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) is a method of resolving disputes outside of the traditional court system. ADR methods are increasingly used in ship chartering disputes as a means of resolving disputes in a more cost-effective, efficient, and flexible manner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are several forms of ADR that can be used in ship chartering disputes, including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mediation:&lt;/strong&gt; Mediation is a voluntary process in which a neutral third party helps the parties to reach a settlement. Mediation can be particularly useful in ship chartering disputes, where parties often have an ongoing business relationship and may wish to preserve that relationship.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;**Arbitration: **Arbitration is a more formal process than mediation, in which an independent third party (the arbitrator) is appointed to make a binding decision on the dispute. Arbitration can be a more cost-effective and efficient means of resolving disputes than traditional court proceedings, and can also provide greater confidentiality and flexibility.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Expert determination:&lt;/strong&gt; Expert determination involves the appointment of an independent expert to determine a specific issue or dispute. Expert determination can be particularly useful in ship chartering disputes, where technical expertise may be required to resolve certain disputes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mini-trial: A&lt;/strong&gt; mini-trial involves the parties presenting their case to a panel of experts, who then provide non-binding recommendations for the resolution of the dispute. The parties can then use these recommendations as the basis for settlement negotiations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) can be a useful tool for resolving ship chartering disputes, as it can help to avoid the time and expense of traditional court proceedings, and can also provide greater flexibility and confidentiality. However, it is important for parties to carefully consider the specific circumstances of their dispute and to choose the appropriate form of Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) that best suits their needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The incorporation of a Charterparty Arbitration Clause&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;the-incorporation-of-a-charterparty-arbitration-clause&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#the-incorporation-of-a-charterparty-arbitration-clause&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The incorporation of a charterparty arbitration clause is a common practice in the shipping industry. A charterparty is a contract between a shipowner and a charterer for the use of a vessel, and the inclusion of an arbitration clause allows parties to resolve any disputes that may arise under the contract through arbitration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The arbitration clause will typically specify the rules that will govern the arbitration, such as the jurisdiction and governing law, the number of arbitrators, and the language of the arbitration. The clause may also specify the location of the arbitration, the qualifications required for the arbitrators, and the procedural rules that will apply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The incorporation of a charterparty arbitration clause can provide several benefits for parties. Arbitration can be a faster and more cost-effective means of resolving disputes than traditional court proceedings. It can also provide greater confidentiality and flexibility, as parties have more control over the arbitration process and the selection of arbitrators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, the incorporation of an arbitration clause can help to avoid potential jurisdictional issues that may arise if disputes are resolved in different courts. It can also provide greater predictability and consistency in the resolution of disputes, as the same set of rules and procedures will apply to all disputes under the contract.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The incorporation of a charterparty arbitration clause is a common and important practice in the shipping industry. It can provide parties with a more efficient, cost-effective, and flexible means of resolving disputes that may arise under the contract.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Co-tidal charts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;co-tidal-charts&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#co-tidal-charts&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Co- Tidal Charts are a valuable tool for mariners, fishermen, coastal engineers, and climate scientists. They provide information about the tidal wave propagation, which is the movement of the tides through the oceans. This information can be used to predict the times and heights of the high and low tides, as well as the direction of the tidal currents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Co-tidal charts are created using a variety of data, including tide gauge data, satellite data, and computer models. The data is used to calculate the tidal wave propagation, which is then used to create the co-tidal charts. Co-tidal charts are typically divided into two types: co-phase charts and co-range charts. Co-phase charts show the time of the high and low tides, while co-range charts show the height of the high and low tides. Co-tidal charts can also be used to predict the direction of the tidal currents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Co-tidal charts are used in a variety of ways, including:&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;co-tidal-charts-are-used-in-a-variety-of-ways-including&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#co-tidal-charts-are-used-in-a-variety-of-ways-including&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Navigation:&lt;/strong&gt; Mariners use co-tidal charts to plan their voyages and to avoid hazards, such as shallow water and strong currents.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fishing:&lt;/strong&gt; Fishermen use co-tidal charts to find the best places to fish and to predict the movement of fish.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Coastal engineering:&lt;/strong&gt; Coastal engineers use co-tidal charts to design coastal structures, such as seawalls and breakwaters.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Climate change research:&lt;/strong&gt; Scientists use co-tidal charts to study the effects of climate change on the tides.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Here are some specific examples of how co-tidal charts are used:&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;here-are-some-specific-examples-of-how-co-tidal-charts-are-used&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#here-are-some-specific-examples-of-how-co-tidal-charts-are-used&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A mariner uses a co-tidal chart to plan a voyage through a narrow channel. The chart shows the mariner when the high and low tides will occur, as well as the direction of the tidal currents. This information allows the mariner to safely navigate the channel.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A fisherman uses a co-tidal chart to find the best place to fish for salmon. The chart shows the fisherman when the tides will be high and low, as well as the direction of the tidal currents. This information allows the fisherman to find the best places to fish and to predict the movement of salmon.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A coastal engineer uses a co-tidal chart to design a seawall. The chart shows the engineer the height of the high and low tides, as well as the direction of the tidal currents. This information allows the engineer to design a seawall that can withstand the forces of the tides and waves.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A scientist uses a co-tidal chart to study the effects of climate change on the tides. The chart shows the scientist how the tides have changed over time. This information allows the scientist to study the effects of climate change on the tides and to predict how the tides will change in the future.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Co-tidal charts are an essential tool for a variety of people and organizations. They provide valuable information about the tidal wave propagation, which can be used to predict the tides, plan voyages, find the best places to fish, design coastal structures, and study the effects of climate change on the tides.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;h2&gt;What is CLCS and describe it&amp;rsquo;s functions.&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;what-is-clcs-and-describe-its-functions&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#what-is-clcs-and-describe-its-functions&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf (CLCS) is a 21-member body of experts established under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) to consider submissions from coastal states on the outer limits of their continental shelf beyond 200 nautical miles from their baselines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CLCS&amp;rsquo;s work is important because the continental shelf is a valuable resource that can contain oil, gas, and other minerals. The CLCS&amp;rsquo;s recommendations help coastal states to determine the extent of their continental shelf and to exploit its resources sustainably.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CLCS&amp;rsquo;s work is also important because it helps to resolve disputes between states over the delimitation of their maritime boundaries. The CLCS&amp;rsquo;s recommendations are not binding, but they are generally respected by coastal states.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CLCS is a highly technical body. Its members are experts in geology, geophysics, oceanography, and international law. The CLCS&amp;rsquo;s work is also highly political, as coastal states have a strong interest in the outcome of the CLCS&amp;rsquo;s recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CLCS plays a vital role in the sustainable management of the oceans. Its work helps to ensure that coastal states can benefit from the resources of their continental shelf in a way that is compatible with the protection of the marine environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Here are some additional details about the CLCS&amp;rsquo;s work:&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;here-are-some-additional-details-about-the-clcss-work&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#here-are-some-additional-details-about-the-clcss-work&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The CLCS&amp;rsquo;s recommendations are based on scientific and technical evidence, including data on the geomorphology of the seabed, the thickness of the sedimentary column, and the natural prolongation of the landmass.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The CLCS&amp;rsquo;s recommendations are also based on the principles of international law, including the principle of equity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The CLCS&amp;rsquo;s work is transparent and inclusive. Coastal states are encouraged to participate in the CLCS&amp;rsquo;s proceedings and to submit their own scientific and technical data.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The CLCS&amp;rsquo;s recommendations have been instrumental in helping coastal states to resolve disputes over the delimitation of their maritime boundaries. For example, the CLCS&amp;rsquo;s recommendations helped to resolve disputes between Bangladesh and India, between Argentina and the United Kingdom, and between Mauritius and the Seychelles.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CLCS is an important institution for the sustainable management of the oceans. Its work helps to ensure that coastal states can benefit from the resources of their continental shelf in a way that is fair and equitable, and that the marine environment is protected.&lt;/p&gt;

Managing coastal development in a sustainable way is important for protecting marine ecosystems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Individuals can also play a role in conserving marine resources by making sustainable choices, such as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reducing their consumption of seafood.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Choosing seafood that has been caught or farmed sustainably.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Avoiding disposable plastics.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Disposing of waste properly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Educating others about the importance of marine conservation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;By taking action to conserve marine resources, we can help to protect these vital ecosystems for future generations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Commercial shipping container operations are the processes involved in the movement of goods in containers between different modes of transport, such as ships, trucks, and trains. Containerization has revolutionized the shipping industry, making it more efficient and cost-effective to transport goods around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Here is a general overview of the commercial shipping container operations process:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Export packing:&lt;/strong&gt; The goods are packed into containers at the factory or warehouse where they are produced or stored. The containers are then sealed and secured to protect the goods during transport.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Transportation to the port:&lt;/strong&gt; The containers are transported to the port by truck, rail, or barge. Once at the port, the containers are unloaded and stored in the container yard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Loading onto the ship:&lt;/strong&gt; Quay cranes are used to load the containers onto the ship. The containers are stacked on the ship&amp;rsquo;s deck in a carefully planned manner to ensure stability and safety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ocean voyage:&lt;/strong&gt; The ship sails to the destination port, carrying the containers with it. The ocean voyage is typically the longest leg of the journey, but it is also the most efficient mode of transport for large volumes of goods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unloading from the ship:&lt;/strong&gt; Once the ship arrives at the destination port, the containers are unloaded using quay cranes. The containers are then stored in the container yard until they are picked up by the importer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Transportation to the importer:&lt;/strong&gt; The containers are transported to the importer&amp;rsquo;s warehouse or distribution center by truck, rail, or barge. Once at the importer&amp;rsquo;s facility, the containers are unloaded and the goods are unpacked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key technologies used in commercial shipping container operations:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quay cranes:&lt;/strong&gt; Quay cranes are specialized cranes that are used to load and unload containers from ships. They are typically equipped with spreaders, which are devices that attach to the containers and allow them to be lifted and lowered safely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Container yard trucks:&lt;/strong&gt; Container yard trucks are heavy-duty trucks that are used to move containers around the container yard. They are typically equipped with lift masts that allow them to pick up and lower containers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Automated guided vehicles (AGVs):&lt;/strong&gt; AGVs are self-driving vehicles that are used to move containers around the container yard. They are often used in conjunction with quay cranes and container yard trucks to automate the loading and unloading process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Container tracking systems:&lt;/strong&gt; Container tracking systems use RFID tags or GPS devices to track the location of containers throughout the shipping process. This information can be used to improve efficiency and visibility in the supply chain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key challenges in commercial shipping container operations:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Port congestion:&lt;/strong&gt; Port congestion can cause delays in the loading and unloading of containers. This can lead to higher costs for shippers and importers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Equipment shortages:&lt;/strong&gt; Equipment shortages, such as quay cranes and container yard trucks, can also cause delays.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Security concerns:&lt;/strong&gt; Containerized cargo is a target for theft and terrorism. Shipping companies and port authorities must implement security measures to protect cargo from these threats.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Environmental impact:&lt;/strong&gt; Shipping containers have a significant environmental impact, both in terms of air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. The shipping industry is working to reduce its environmental impact by developing more efficient ships and fuels.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Despite the challenges, commercial shipping container operations are essential to the global economy. By transporting goods efficiently and cost-effectively, container shipping helps to connect businesses and consumers around the world.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Control in hydrographic surveying</title>
      <link>https://www.anirbanmarine.in/docs/partc/em301/hydrosurv/control/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>
        
        
        &lt;p&gt;Control in hydrographic surveying is the process of establishing a network of known horizontal and vertical positions that is used to reference all other survey measurements. Control is essential for ensuring the accuracy and reliability of hydrographic surveys.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two main types of control in hydrographic surveying: horizontal control and vertical control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Horizontal control&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;horizontal-control&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#horizontal-control&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;establishes the horizontal position of survey points. It is typically established using a network of geodetic survey markers, such as triangulation stations and GPS reference points. Horizontal control can also be established using photogrammetric methods, such as aerial photography and satellite imagery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Vertical control&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;vertical-control&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#vertical-control&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;establishes the vertical position of survey points. It is typically established using a network of bench marks, which are fixed points with known elevations. Vertical control can also be established using tidal gauges and GPS measurements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the horizontal and vertical control networks have been established, survey points can be referenced to the control network using a variety of positioning technologies, such as GPS, DGPS, and GNSS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;** Control** is essential for hydrographic surveying because it ensures that all survey measurements are referenced to a common coordinate system. This is important for ensuring the accuracy and reliability of the survey results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to ensuring accuracy, control also provides a number of other benefits for hydrographic surveys. For example, control can be used to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reduce the amount of time and resources required to complete a survey.&lt;/strong&gt; By using control, hydrographic surveyors can avoid having to resurvey areas that have already been surveyed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Improve the quality of survey data.&lt;/strong&gt; Control can help to identify and correct errors in survey data.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Integrate data from different sources.&lt;/strong&gt; Control can be used to integrate data from different hydrographic surveys, as well as data from other sources, such as aerial photography and satellite imagery.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Control networks for hydrographic surveys are typically designed and established by geodetic surveyors. However, hydrographic surveyors are responsible for ensuring that the control network is adequate for the specific needs of their survey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Here are some of the factors that hydrographic surveyors need to consider when planning and executing a survey:&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;here-are-some-of-the-factors-that-hydrographic-surveyors-need-to-consider-when-planning-and-executing-a-survey&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#here-are-some-of-the-factors-that-hydrographic-surveyors-need-to-consider-when-planning-and-executing-a-survey&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The size and complexity of the survey area.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The required accuracy of the survey results.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The availability of existing control points.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The budget and time constraints of the survey.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The specific hydrographic survey methods that will be used.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the hydrographic surveyor has considered all of these factors, they can develop a plan for establishing a control network. The specific control techniques that are used will vary depending on the factors listed above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, a hydrographic survey of a small harbor might use a simple control network of existing triangulation stations. A hydrographic survey of a large offshore area might require a more complex control network, including new GPS reference points, tide gauges, and photogrammetric methods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Control is an essential element of hydrographic surveying. It ensures that all survey measurements are referenced to a common coordinate system and that the survey results are accurate and reliable. Hydrographic surveyors carefully plan and execute their surveys to ensure that the control network is adequate for the specific needs of their project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Case study: Hydrographic survey of a new port**&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;case-study-hydrographic-survey-of-a-new-port&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#case-study-hydrographic-survey-of-a-new-port&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new port is being built on a previously uncharted stretch of coastline. The hydrographic survey team is responsible for creating a detailed map of the seabed in the port area. The survey team will use this map to design the port and to ensure that it is safe for ships to enter and leave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The survey team begins by establishing a control network. They use GPS to survey a number of points on the coastline. These points will be used as references for all other survey measurements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the control network is in place, the survey team begins to collect data on the seabed. They use a variety of hydrographic survey methods, including multibeam sonar and side scan sonar. These methods allow the survey team to create a detailed three-dimensional image of the seabed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The survey team collects data on the depth of the water, the position of underwater features, and the composition of the seabed. This data is then processed using specialized software to create a nautical chart of the port area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The nautical chart shows the depth of water, the position of underwater features, and other important information for navigation. The port authorities will use this chart to design the port and to ensure that it is safe for ships to enter and leave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This case study demonstrates the importance of control in hydrographic surveying. Control is essential for ensuring that all survey measurements are accurate and reliable. This is especially important for high-stakes projects, such as the construction of a new port.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Cyclonic Storms</title>
      <link>https://www.anirbanmarine.in/docs/partc/em301/meteorology/cyclones/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>
        
        
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is a Cyclonic storm?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cyclonic storms, also known as tropical cyclones, hurricanes, and typhoons, are rotating wind systems that form over warm ocean waters. They are characterized by a central region of low atmospheric pressure and strong winds that rotate in a counterclockwise direction in the Northern Hemisphere and clockwise direction in the Southern Hemisphere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How is a cyclonic storm formed?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The formation of cyclonic storms is a complex process that requires a number of factors to come together, including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Warm ocean waters: Cyclonic storms need warm ocean waters (at least 26°C or 79°F) to form and develop. The warm water provides the energy that drives the storm.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Low wind shear: Cyclonic storms also need low wind shear, which is the change in wind direction and speed with altitude. High wind shear can disrupt the storm&amp;rsquo;s circulation and prevent it from developing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Atmospheric instability: Cyclonic storms also need atmospheric instability, which is a condition in which the atmosphere is prone to rising air. Rising air can cool and condense, forming clouds and rain.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once these conditions are met, a cyclonic storm can begin to form. The process typically starts with a small disturbance in the atmosphere, such as a wave on a weather front. As the disturbance grows, it begins to draw in warm, moist air from the surrounding ocean. This air rises and cools, forming clouds and rain. The rising air also releases latent heat, which further energizes the storm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the storm continues to grow, it develops a central region of low atmospheric pressure. This low pressure draws in even more air, which causes the winds to strengthen. The storm also develops a characteristic eye, which is a region of calm, clear air in the center of the storm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cyclonic storms can reach wind speeds of over 250 kilometers per hour (155 miles per hour). They can also produce heavy rains and storm surges that can cause significant damage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Here are the stages of cyclone formation:&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;here-are-the-stages-of-cyclone-formation&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#here-are-the-stages-of-cyclone-formation&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Incipient disturbance: This is the early stage of development, when a small disturbance in the atmosphere begins to form.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tropical depression: The disturbance develops into a tropical depression when the winds reach speeds of at least 35 kilometers per hour (22 miles per hour).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tropical storm: The tropical depression becomes a tropical storm when the winds reach speeds of at least 65 kilometers per hour (40 miles per hour).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hurricane: The tropical storm becomes a hurricane when the winds reach speeds of at least 119 kilometers per hour (74 miles per hour).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cyclonic storms can continue to intensify after they reach hurricane strength. The strongest hurricanes can have wind speeds of over 300 kilometers per hour (186 miles per hour).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cyclonic storms are a major natural hazard, and they can cause significant damage to life and property. It is important to be aware of the risks posed by cyclones and to have a plan in place if a cyclone is approaching your area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Rapid intensification of Cyclonic storm&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;rapid-intensification-of-cyclonic-storm&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#rapid-intensification-of-cyclonic-storm&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is rapid intensification of a cyclonic storm?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cyclonic storms can intensify rapidly, increasing in wind speed and size in a short period of time. This process is known as rapid intensification. The United States National Hurricane Center defines rapid intensification as an increase in the maximum sustained winds of a tropical cyclone of at least 30 knots (35 mph; 55 km/h) in a 24-hour period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a number of factors that can contribute to the intensification of a cyclonic storm, including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Warm ocean waters: Cyclonic storms need warm ocean waters to intensify. The warm water provides the energy that drives the storm.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Low wind shear: Cyclonic storms also need low wind shear to intensify. High wind shear can disrupt the storm&amp;rsquo;s circulation and prevent it from developing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Atmospheric instability: Cyclonic storms also need atmospheric instability to intensify. This is a condition in which the atmosphere is prone to rising air. Rising air can cool and condense, forming clouds and rain.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other factors that can contribute to rapid intensification include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The presence of a mesoscale convective vortex (MCV): An MCV is a small rotating area of thunderstorms within a tropical cyclone. MCVs can help to enhance the cyclone&amp;rsquo;s circulation and lead to rapid intensification.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The presence of a brown ocean vortex (BOV): A BOV is a swirling mass of warm water that can form beneath a tropical cyclone. BOVs can provide additional energy to the cyclone, helping it to intensify more quickly.
Rapid intensification can be a dangerous process, as it can make it difficult for forecasters to predict the storm&amp;rsquo;s track and intensity. It can also lead to unexpected and severe impacts on coastal communities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In recent years, there has been a trend towards more rapid intensification of tropical cyclones. This is thought to be due to a combination of factors, including climate change, which is leading to warmer ocean waters, and natural variability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scientists are working to better understand the factors that contribute to rapid intensification and to develop improved forecasting methods. This will help to reduce the risk of loss of life and property from tropical cyclones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Forecasting of tropical cyclones has improved greatly in recent years.&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;forecasting-of-tropical-cyclones-has-improved-greatly-in-recent-years&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#forecasting-of-tropical-cyclones-has-improved-greatly-in-recent-years&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are certain areas over the oceans that are particularly favourable for tropical cyclone development, but it is usually certain characteristics in a cluster of thunderclouds that leads forecasters to recognise them as tropical depressions. This is done by people at specialist tropical cyclone forecasting centres around the globe such as the National Hurricane Center in Miami, Florida who are constantly studying satellite images, instruments and other weather data to detect and track them through their life-cycle. Once detected, their track is forecast using a combination of numerical forecasting models, synoptic forecasting and statistical methods, which have been developed from the study of the behaviour of past storms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Observations from ships at sea are always very useful, although, once the existence of a storm and its forecast track have been broadcast, ships tend to move out of their way! Reinforced aircraft, fitted with instruments, fly through and over tropical cyclones, and weather radar can locate storms within 200 miles of the radar station. In addition, tropical cyclones are tracked by satellites, which provide very useful information both to forecasters and numerical forecast models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Official&amp;rdquo; responsibility for forecasting tropical cyclones in the areas affected lies with the regional centres such as the National Hurricane Center in Miami. However, the Met Office does produce tropical cyclone forecasts from its global model, which are disseminated to the regional centres. They then use these forecasts, along with other forms of guidance, to produce their forecasts. Met Office forecasts of tropical cyclones show considerable skill and are among the best models available to agencies such as the National Hurricane Center.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Measuring tropical cyclones&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;measuring-tropical-cyclones&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#measuring-tropical-cyclones&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In order to categorise tropical cyclones around the world, the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale is used defining events by their wind speed and impacts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although developed in the USA, tropical cyclones around the world are measured by the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale which originated from 1971 with Herbert Saffir, a civil engineer and Bob Simpson of the US National Hurricane Center.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale consists of a five point scale of hurricane intensity and starts at 74 mph. Tropical cyclones with wind speeds up to 38 mph are classified as tropical depressions and those with wind speeds from 39 - 73 mph are classified as tropical storms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is important to note that whilst the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale defines wind strengths and their likely impacts, severe impacts from tropical cyclones can also occur due to storm surge and heavy rain which are not necessarily directly related to the strength of the wind in the tropical cyclone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;saffir-simpson-hurricane-wind-scale&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#saffir-simpson-hurricane-wind-scale&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Category 1&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;category-1&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#category-1&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wind (mph): 74 - 95&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Damage: Minimal - No significant structural damage, can uproot trees and cause some flooding in coastal areas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Category 2&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;category-2&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#category-2&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wind (mph): 96 - 110&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moderate - No major destruction to buildings, can uproot trees and signs. Coastal flooding can occur. Secondary effects can include the shortage of water and electricity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Category 3&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;category-3&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#category-3&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wind (mph): 111 - 129&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Extensive - Structural damage to small buildings and serious coastal flooding to those on low lying land. Evacuation may be needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Category 4&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;category-4&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Extreme - All signs and trees blown down with extensive damage to roofs. Flat land inland may become flooded. Evacuation probable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Category 5&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;category-5&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#category-5&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wind (mph): greater than 156&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Catastrophic - Buildings destroyed with small buildings being overturned. All trees and signs blown down. Evacuation of up to 10 miles inland&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Deductions from Freight</title>

      <description>
        
        
        &lt;p&gt;Any deductions from freight should be made only if there is &lt;strong&gt;express agreement&lt;/strong&gt; in the charterparty, for example, Address Commission or Brokerage Commission, Cash to Master etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under English law there is a rule known as equitable set-off where claims may be deducted from monies being under a contract, this rule does not apply to freight and was firmly established in The Aries (1977). The Aries (1977) case covered a cargo of oil, where freight was payable on the intaken quantity on delivery of the cargo. The charterer deducted $30,000 from freight, without owners consent, in respect of a claim for damages for short delivery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The charterers, presumably feeling that their loss had been recovered, did not actually lodge a claim for the short delivery, which would have in some measure justified the deduction. Two years after delivery the owners started proceedings to claim the balance of freight. The charterers argued that the ordinary rules of set-off should apply and that freight should not be treated as a special case. The case reached the House of Lords who found in favour of owners. Briefly the judgment stated: ‘that the rule with regard to freight was so firmly established, it would be wrong to depart from it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, since the 12 month time limit in the Hague Rules did not merely bar the remedy, but extinguished the claim, there was no claim the charterers could set-off, even where there were a set-off permissible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The deduction made by the charterer, to which the shipowners had not agreed, had &lt;strong&gt;no legal significance&lt;/strong&gt; and did not relieve the charterer of the need to commence suit within 12 months, if he wished shipowner’s liability for the cargo damage to remain in existence.’ The simple rule for the charterer then is to pay the freight as agreed and commence proceedings against the owner to recover losses.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Demersal and pelagic fishing are two different types of fishing that target different types of fish in different habitats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Demersal fishing&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;demersal-fishing&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#demersal-fishing&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;is the fishing of fish that live on or near the bottom of the ocean. These fish are also known as groundfish. Demersal fish are typically caught using bottom trawls, gillnets, and longlines.Some examples of demersal fish include cod, haddock, flounder, sole, and shrimp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Pelagic fishing&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;pelagic-fishing&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#pelagic-fishing&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;is the fishing of fish that live in the open ocean, away from the bottom. These fish are also known as midwater fish. Pelagic fish are typically caught using purse seines, pelagic trawls, and troll lines.Some examples of pelagic fish include tuna, mackerel, herring, and sardines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both demersal and pelagic fishing can have a significant impact on marine ecosystems. Overfishing is a major threat to both types of fish populations. Demersal fishing can also damage the seabed, which can impact other marine organisms. Pelagic fishing can lead to bycatch, which is the accidental capture of non-target species, such as seabirds and dolphins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is important to manage demersal and pelagic fisheries sustainably to ensure that these resources remain available for future generations. Some sustainable fishing practices include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using selective fishing gear to avoid bycatch.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Setting catch limits to prevent overfishing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Protecting spawning grounds and other important fish habitats.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Monitoring fish populations to ensure that they are healthy and sustainable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Individuals can also play a role in supporting sustainable demersal and pelagic fisheries by choosing seafood that has been caught or farmed sustainably.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;h2&gt;There are two main types of desalination processes: thermal and membrane.&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;there-are-two-main-types-of-desalination-processes-thermal-and-membrane&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#there-are-two-main-types-of-desalination-processes-thermal-and-membrane&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Thermal desalination&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;thermal-desalination&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#thermal-desalination&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;processes use heat to evaporate seawater, leaving behind the salt and impurities. The most common thermal desalination processes are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Multi-stage flash distillation (MSF):&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;multi-stage-flash-distillation-msf&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#multi-stage-flash-distillation-msf&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;MSF is the most mature thermal desalination technology. In MSF, seawater is heated to a high temperature and then flashed into steam. The steam is then condensed to produce fresh water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Multiple-effect distillation (MED):&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;multiple-effect-distillation-med&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#multiple-effect-distillation-med&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;MED is similar to MSF, but it uses a series of chambers with different temperatures and pressures to improve efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Vapor compression distillation (VCD):&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;vapor-compression-distillation-vcd&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#vapor-compression-distillation-vcd&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;VCD uses a compressor to increase the pressure of seawater. This causes the seawater to boil at a lower temperature, which reduces the energy required for the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Membrane desalination processes&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;membrane-desalination-processes&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#membrane-desalination-processes&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;use semi-permeable membranes to filter out the salt and impurities from seawater. The most common membrane desalination process is reverse osmosis (RO).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Reverse osmosis (RO)&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;reverse-osmosis-ro&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#reverse-osmosis-ro&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;works by applying pressure to seawater to force it through a semi-permeable membrane. The membrane allows water molecules to pass through, but it blocks the salt and impurities. RO is the most energy-efficient desalination process, and it is becoming increasingly popular as the cost of membranes has decreased.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other membrane desalination processes include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Electrodialysis:&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;electrodialysis&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#electrodialysis&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Electrodialysis uses electrical energy to move ions through a series of membranes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Nanofiltration:&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;nanofiltration&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#nanofiltration&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nanofiltration is similar to RO, but it uses a different type of membrane that allows some smaller ions to pass through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best desalination process for a particular application depends on a number of factors, including the salinity of the water, the required production capacity, the energy cost, and the environmental impact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Advantages and disadvantages of desalination processes&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;advantages-and-disadvantages-of-desalination-processes&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#advantages-and-disadvantages-of-desalination-processes&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Advantages&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;advantages&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#advantages&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Desalination can provide a reliable source of fresh water in areas with limited freshwater resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Desalination can help to reduce stress on existing freshwater resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Desalination can create jobs and boost the economy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Disadvantages&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;disadvantages&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#disadvantages&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Desalination can be expensive, especially for large-scale plants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Desalination plants can consume a lot of energy.
Desalination plants can produce brine, which is a concentrated wastewater that can be difficult to dispose of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#conclusion&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Desalination is a growing technology that has the potential to help solve the world&amp;rsquo;s water crisis. However, it is important to weigh the advantages and disadvantages of desalination before building a desalination plant.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Differences between dry cargo and tanker chartering</title>
      <link>https://www.anirbanmarine.in/docs/partc/em303/cshipmgmt/diffdcrgotnkchrtr/</link>

      <description>
        
        
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Differences between dry cargo and tanker chartering:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Type of cargo:&lt;/strong&gt; Dry cargo chartering involves the carriage of dry cargo, such as iron ore, coal, and grain. Tanker chartering involves the carriage of liquid cargo, such as oil and chemicals.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ship type:&lt;/strong&gt; Dry cargo chartering typically involves the use of bulk carriers, general cargo ships, and container ships. Tanker chartering typically involves the use of crude oil tankers, product tankers, and chemical tankers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cargo handling:&lt;/strong&gt; Dry cargo is typically loaded and discharged using cranes and other mechanical handling equipment. Liquid cargo is typically loaded and discharged using pumps and pipelines.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cargo specifications:&lt;/strong&gt; Dry cargo specifications are typically less stringent than liquid cargo specifications. Liquid cargo specifications are typically more stringent due to the potential for environmental damage in the event of a spill.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Risk:&lt;/strong&gt; Tanker chartering is generally considered to be more risky than dry cargo chartering. This is due to the potential for environmental damage in the event of a spill.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Similarities between dry cargo and tanker chartering:&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;similarities-between-dry-cargo-and-tanker-chartering&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#similarities-between-dry-cargo-and-tanker-chartering&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Types of charter parties:&lt;/strong&gt; Both dry cargo and tanker chartering can be done on a voyage or time charter basis.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Common terms:&lt;/strong&gt; Many of the common terms used in dry cargo charter parties are also used in tanker charter parties, such as freight rate, laytime, demurrage, and despatch.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Negotiation process:&lt;/strong&gt; The negotiation process for dry cargo and tanker charter parties is similar. Both the charterer and shipowner will need to negotiate the terms of the charter party, such as the freight rate, laytime, demurrage, and despatch.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, dry cargo and tanker chartering are similar in many ways. However, there are some important differences, such as the type of cargo, ship type, cargo handling, cargo specifications, and risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Here is a table that summarizes the key differences and similarities between dry cargo and tanker chartering:&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;here-is-a-table-that-summarizes-the-key-differences-and-similarities-between-dry-cargo-and-tanker-chartering&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;h2&gt;Public ports&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;public-ports&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#public-ports&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Public ports are owned and operated by the government. The government may be responsible for all aspects of port management, including infrastructure development, cargo handling, and marketing. Public ports are typically subject to government regulation, and their rates and services are often subsidized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Examples of public ports include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Port of Los Angeles, California&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Port of New York and New Jersey&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Port of Rotterdam, Netherlands&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Private ports&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;private-ports&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#private-ports&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Private ports are owned and operated by private companies. Private ports may be fully or partially privatized. Fully privatized ports are owned by private companies and operate with little or no government involvement. Partially privatized ports may be owned by a combination of public and private entities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Examples of private ports include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Port of Dubai, United Arab Emirates&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Port of Singapore&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Port of Gioia Tauro, Italy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Landlord ports&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;landlord-ports&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#landlord-ports&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Landlord ports are a hybrid form of port ownership that combines elements of public and private ownership. In a landlord port, the government owns the port land and infrastructure, but leases it to private companies to operate. The private companies are responsible for building and operating cargo terminals, warehouses, and other port facilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Examples of landlord ports include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Port of Hong Kong&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Port of Tanjung Priok, Indonesia&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Port of Piraeus, Greece&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Full or part service provider terminal facilities within ports&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;full-or-part-service-provider-terminal-facilities-within-ports&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

Some terminal facilities may be fully owned and operated by a single entity, while others may be partially owned and operated by multiple entities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Examples of full or part service provider terminal facilities within ports include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Container terminal operated by MSC (private company) at the Port of Piraeus, Greece&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ro-Ro terminal operated by PSA (joint venture between the Singapore government and PSA International) at the Port of Algeciras, Spain&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dry bulk terminal operated by APM Terminals (private company) at the Port of Rotterdam, Netherlands&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Ports are essential nodes in the global transportation network, connecting ships, trains, trucks, and airplanes. They play a vital role in trade and economic development by facilitating the movement of goods and people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hub ports&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;hub-ports&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

They are typically located in strategic locations along major shipping routes and have the capacity to handle a wide variety of cargo. Hub ports often serve as feeder ports for smaller ports in the region.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Feeder or transshipment ports&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;feeder-or-transshipment-ports&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#feeder-or-transshipment-ports&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Feeder ports are smaller ports that connect to hub ports by ship. They collect cargo from smaller ports and nearby areas and transport it to hub ports for consolidation and onward shipment to other parts of the world. Feeder ports also play an important role in distributing cargo from hub ports to smaller ports and inland areas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Intermodal interfaces&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;intermodal-interfaces&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

They play an important role in facilitating the efficient movement of goods between different modes of transportation. Intermodal interfaces often have facilities for storing and handling cargo, as well as for transloading cargo from one mode of transportation to another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Examples of ports by function&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;examples-of-ports-by-function&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

      <title>Distribution of Salinity, Temperature and Density of Water</title>
      <link>https://www.anirbanmarine.in/docs/partc/em301/oceanogeo/watermass/</link>

      <description>
        
        
        &lt;h2&gt;The distribution of salinity, temperature, and density of water masses is determined by a number of factors, including:&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;the-distribution-of-salinity-temperature-and-density-of-water-masses-is-determined-by-a-number-of-factors-including&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#the-distribution-of-salinity-temperature-and-density-of-water-masses-is-determined-by-a-number-of-factors-including&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Latitude:&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;latitude&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#latitude&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Salinity and temperature generally decrease with increasing latitude. This is because the sun&amp;rsquo;s rays are more intense at the equator, which causes the water to evaporate and leave behind the salt. The evaporated water then travels to the poles, where it condenses and falls as precipitation. This precipitation dilutes the salinity of the ocean water and lowers its temperature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Depth:&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;depth&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#depth&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Salinity and temperature generally decrease with increasing depth. This is because the sun&amp;rsquo;s rays cannot penetrate very deep into the ocean, so the water is not as warm. Additionally, the pressure at greater depths is higher, which causes the water to become denser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Ocean currents:&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;ocean-currents&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#ocean-currents&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ocean currents can transport water masses from one region to another, which can have a significant impact on the distribution of salinity, temperature, and density. For example, the Gulf Stream transports warm, salty water from the Gulf of Mexico to the North Atlantic Ocean. This warm water helps to keep the North Atlantic Ocean relatively warm, even in the winter months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Water Masses:&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;water-masses&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#water-masses&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Water masses are defined by their characteristic salinity and temperature properties. They are formed when water with a specific salinity and temperature range sinks below the surrounding water. This sinking can occur at high latitudes, where the water is very cold and dense, or at convergences, where two different water masses meet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once a water mass has formed, it can travel long distances throughout the ocean. Water masses play an important role in global climate and ocean circulation. They transport heat and nutrients around the globe, and they can influence the formation of storms and other weather patterns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Here is a general overview of the distribution of salinity, temperature, and density in the world&amp;rsquo;s oceans:&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;here-is-a-general-overview-of-the-distribution-of-salinity-temperature-and-density-in-the-worlds-oceans&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#here-is-a-general-overview-of-the-distribution-of-salinity-temperature-and-density-in-the-worlds-oceans&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Surface salinity:&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;surface-salinity&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#surface-salinity&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Surface salinity is highest in the subtropics and tropics, where the sun&amp;rsquo;s rays are most intense. It is lowest in the polar regions, where there is more precipitation and less evaporation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Surface temperature:&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;surface-temperature&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#surface-temperature&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Surface temperature is also highest in the subtropics and tropics, and lowest in the polar regions. However, there are also significant regional variations in surface temperature. For example, the eastern equatorial Pacific Ocean is much cooler than the western equatorial Pacific Ocean. This is due to the upwelling of cold water from the deep ocean in the eastern Pacific.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Deep ocean salinity and temperature:&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;deep-ocean-salinity-and-temperature&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#deep-ocean-salinity-and-temperature&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deep ocean is much colder and more saline than the surface ocean. This is because the deep ocean is not warmed by the sun&amp;rsquo;s rays, and it is under a great deal of pressure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Water masses:&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;water-masses-1&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#water-masses-1&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The world&amp;rsquo;s oceans can be divided into a number of different water masses, each with its own characteristic salinity and temperature properties. Some of the most important water masses include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Central Water:&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;central-water&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#central-water&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Central Water is found in the central basins of the world&amp;rsquo;s oceans. It is typically warm and salty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Subtropical Water:&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;subtropical-water&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#subtropical-water&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Subtropical Water is found in the subtropics and tropics. It is typically very warm and salty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Subpolar Water:&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;subpolar-water&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#subpolar-water&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Subpolar Water is found in the subpolar regions. It is typically cold and salty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Polar Water:&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;polar-water&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#polar-water&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Polar Water is found in the polar regions. It is very cold and fresh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Water masses move around the globe through ocean currents. For example, the Gulf Stream transports Central Water from the Gulf of Mexico to the North Atlantic Ocean. The North Atlantic Drift then transports this water further north, where it eventually sinks and forms North Atlantic Deep Water. North Atlantic Deep Water is a very cold and dense water mass that sinks to the bottom of the ocean and flows southward. It eventually spreads out into all of the world&amp;rsquo;s oceans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The distribution of salinity, temperature, and density of water masses has a significant impact on marine life and ecosystems. For example, some marine organisms are adapted to living in specific salinity and temperature ranges. Additionally, the movement of water masses can transport nutrients and food sources around the globe, which can influence the distribution of marine life.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Dry cargo chartering is the process of negotiating and agreeing to a contract for the carriage of dry cargo by sea. Dry cargo charter parties can be complex and vary depending on the specific terms agreed upon by the charterer and shipowner. However, there are some common features of dry cargo charter parties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Types of dry cargo charter parties&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two main types of dry cargo charter parties: voyage charter parties and time charter parties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Voyage charter parties:&lt;/strong&gt; Voyage charter parties are agreements for the carriage of a specific quantity of cargo from one port to another. The charterer pays the shipowner a freight rate, which is typically calculated based on the amount of cargo transported and the distance traveled.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Time charter parties:&lt;/strong&gt; Time charter parties are agreements for the charterer to have the use of a ship for a specific period of time. The charterer pays the shipowner a time charter rate, which is typically calculated based on the size of the ship and the duration of the charter.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Common terms in dry cargo charter parties&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;common-terms-in-dry-cargo-charter-parties&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#common-terms-in-dry-cargo-charter-parties&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of the common terms in dry cargo charter parties include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Freight rate:&lt;/strong&gt; The freight rate is the price that the charterer pays to the shipowner for the carriage of the cargo.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Laytime:&lt;/strong&gt; Laytime is the amount of time that the charterer has to load and discharge the cargo.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Demurrage:&lt;/strong&gt; Demurrage is a charge that the charterer pays to the shipowner for each day that the laytime is exceeded.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Despatch:&lt;/strong&gt; Despatch is a bonus that the shipowner pays to the charterer for each day that the laytime is saved.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Loading and discharging ports:&lt;/strong&gt; The loading and discharging ports are the ports where the cargo will be loaded and discharged.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cargo specifications:&lt;/strong&gt; The cargo specifications include the type of cargo, the quantity of cargo, and the condition of the cargo.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;War risk insurance:&lt;/strong&gt; War risk insurance is insurance that protects the shipowner and charterer from losses caused by war or other hostilities.&lt;/li&gt;

The charterer and shipowner will need to negotiate the terms of the charter party, such as the freight rate, laytime, demurrage, and despatch. The charterer will also need to provide the shipowner with the cargo specifications and arrange for war risk insurance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the terms of the charter party have been agreed upon, the charterer and shipowner will need to sign the charter party. The charter party will then be legally binding on both parties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dry Bulk Shipping&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;dry-bulk-shipping&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#dry-bulk-shipping&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dry bulk trades have been transformed over the past three decades. The average size of ships engaged in dry bulk trades has doubled in size. Dry bulk trades have in fact evolved from the tramp shipping market. Tramp markets were served by small, general-purpose ships. Historically, general-purpose ships were steaming the ports in search of business, spot market cargoes. Shipowners use a global network of shipbrokers to seek cargoes for their ships. Shipbrokers perform a fundamental function in providing information to both shipowners and charterers. As cargo lot sizes and ship sizes have increased, there is a tendency for significant charterers to use long time charters, consecutive voyage charters, and contracts of affreightment. Despite the growth in these types of contracts, there is still a huge volume of spot charters and spot ship chartering is a very competitive market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dry cargo market can be defined using two basic methods:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tramp Ship&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tramp Market Characteristics&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tramp Ship&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1959, Hector Gripaios defined the tramp ship as a “deep-sea tramp ship carry any cargo between any port at any time, always providing that the venture is both legal and safe”. In 1972, Prof. Metaxas’ book “The Economics of Tramp Shipping” was published. Prof. Metaxas defined the tramp ship as “ship with a tonnage of 4,000 DWT or above, which in the long-run does not have a fixed itinerary, and which carries mainly dry cargo in bulk over relatively long distances and from one or more ports to one or more ports is an ocean or deep sea tramp”. Both tramp ship definitions emphasize the fact that tramp ships have &lt;strong&gt;no&lt;/strong&gt; fixed pattern of employment. The minimum ship size and deep-sea nature of the tramp ship is introduced by Prof. Metaxas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tramp Market Characteristics&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Defining the dry cargo market with specific ship characteristics have some drawbacks. In the dry bulk shipping market, cargo volumes and average lot sizes have increased since the 1970s. Hence, the average size of most ship types dramatically increased. Modern dry bulk ships are more specialized than the old tramps and dry bulk ship size reached up to 400,000 DWT. On the other hand, larger ships require larger capital requirements, shipowners are only prepared to risk the commitment to such large ships if shipowners have long-term contracts. Handysize, handymax, panamax, capesize bulk carriers are more specialized and are often employed on contracts of affreightment (COA). Contracts of affreightment (COA) permits the shipowner to meet the charterer’s requirements by using more than one ship. The modern definition of the dry bulk market would need to include the development of these long-term contracts. Freight rates for these long-term contracts are still influenced by the spot market. Dry cargo definition that is based upon market characteristics might be more applicable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In dry cargo markets, most shipping contracts between charterers and shipowners become well known to all the market participants through &lt;strong&gt;shipbroking companies&lt;/strong&gt;. Therefore, all participants in dry cargo markets know the prevailing levels of freight rates and can make decisions accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dry cargo markets include many types of contracts such as spot fixtures, consecutive voyages, contracts of affreightment (COA), time charters. Dry cargo markets’ clearest definition may be found in the market characteristics rather than in the particular specification of the ship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dry bulk freight market is a very competitive market and very close to the perfectly competitive market model. Important features of a perfectly competitive market model:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Every supplier seeks to maximize profits&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Numerous buyers and sellers in the market&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The service offered by each shipping company is exactly the same as every other company&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Easy exit from and entry to the market.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Full information is available to all participants in the market place&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dry cargo market fulfills all of the features of a perfectly competitive market model. Shipowners and charterers seek to maximize their profits. A large number of shipowners and charterers in the dry bulk market. No single shipowner or single charterer of the dry bulk market can influence the behavior of freight rates. Dry bulk freight rates cannot be fixed. Dry bulk freight rates are driven by overall demand and supply conditions. All shipping companies in the dry bulk market offer the same service, same cargo space, and safe transportation of cargo in a timely manner. Assuming that the analysis is based on ships of an acceptable standard. Entry and exit from the dry bulk market are fairly easy. Easy does &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; mean costless. A person can enter the dry bulk market by buying a secondhand ship or by ordering a newbuilding ship and becomes a shipowner. New shipowners would not suffer a cost disadvantage from entering the dry bulk market. On the other hand, if the shipowner earns unsatisfactory profits and sees no long-term prospects for recovery, then the shipowner can put the ship up for sale and exit dry bulk market. If the shipowner would incur a loss when selling the ship, this could be a barrier to exiting. If many shipowners cannot make profits, and buyers are few, shipowners can either lay up or scrap the ship. If the ship is scrapped, a dry bulk market exit occurs. Entry and exit are easy in dry bulk market because existing shipowners have no way of preventing such a process. In the dry bulk market, full market information is available to all participants by Baltic Exchange. &lt;strong&gt;Shipbrokers&lt;/strong&gt; act as information transmitters. Shipbrokers ensure that all dry bulk market players are kept fully informed of any event that might affect the market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One crucial characteristic of a competitive dry bulk market is that shipowners have &lt;strong&gt;no individual influence&lt;/strong&gt; over market freight rates. Profit is made in the margin between revenues and costs. The only element that shipowners have control over cost. Competitive markets tend to be driven by cost trends, rather than by demand features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dry Bulk Market Trends Over the Past 30 Years&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the past 30 years, the &lt;strong&gt;total volume of cargo&lt;/strong&gt; has more than doubled at an annual average compound &lt;strong&gt;growth rate&lt;/strong&gt; of &lt;strong&gt;4.5%&lt;/strong&gt; per year. Demand growth is much more &lt;strong&gt;uneven&lt;/strong&gt; on a year-to-year basis over the past 30 years. The highest rate of growth to be observed occurred in 2010, at &lt;strong&gt;12.1%&lt;/strong&gt;. 2010 growth rate is about three times the long-term average. Since 1995, &lt;strong&gt;ship tonnage growth&lt;/strong&gt; rate has fluctuated between -2.8% and 12.1%. Over the past 30 years, shipping demand growth tends to move in cycles of good years, medium years, poor years, and back again. In other words, freight rates rate peaks, declines, becomes negative, recovers again. Shipping cycles exist around a rising trend in the total volume of cargo moved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the period 1999-2015, the growth rate of &lt;strong&gt;tonne-mile&lt;/strong&gt; demand has varied between -2.7% and 13. 1%. In the period 1999-2015, &lt;strong&gt;tonne-mile&lt;/strong&gt; demand increased by &lt;strong&gt;5.2%&lt;/strong&gt; per year compound, on the other hand, &lt;strong&gt;cargo tonnes&lt;/strong&gt; moved grew by &lt;strong&gt;4.5%&lt;/strong&gt; per year. Differences in the growth of tonnage demand and tonne-mile demand imply that journey distances have fluctuated. The average haul has declined from 5,508 miles in 1999 to 5,437 in 2015. In the period 1999-2015, the growth rate of the &lt;strong&gt;dry bulk fleet&lt;/strong&gt; has averaged &lt;strong&gt;5.7%&lt;/strong&gt; per year. In sum, between 1999-2015, supply capacity has exceeded demand. Ship supply capacity should properly be measured in terms of &lt;strong&gt;tonne-mile&lt;/strong&gt;. Furthermore, the laid-up fleet has been steadily declining since 1992.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cost Structure of Tramp Ship Operators&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tramp ship operators have to identify and split their costs between &lt;strong&gt;fixed&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;variable&lt;/strong&gt; costs in the short run. In the shipping business, most variable costs related to producing shipping output, in other words undertaking a voyage. The distinction between avoidable (variable) and unavoidable (fixed) costs is also useful when making operational decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ship Lay-up Decision&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tramp ship operators to lay up a ship or to continue to trade is a complex decision. If the trip loses money i.e. freight revenues are less than the total costs, then the ship could not be laid up. Because lay-up is &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; a costless activity, lay-up costs money. During the lay-up, some costs will be reduced. On the other hand, the ship has to be maintained, provided with some power, anchored safe lay-up position, and skeleton crew provisions must be provided. Unavoidable (fixed) costs will be incurred by the shipowner whether the ship trades or lays-up. Fixed costs are common in both situations whether the ship trades or lays-up. Hence, fixed costs &lt;strong&gt;cannot&lt;/strong&gt; affect the outcome of the lay-up decision. For example, the shipowner estimates that daily operating costs are $12,000 for a ship in a trading condition and $5,000 in lay-up. $4,000 of this cost is assumed to be the capital cost of owning the ship. Capital cost is a fixed cost and unavoidable. Therefore, capital costs can be canceled out. Relevant costs become $8,000 per day when trading and $1,000 per day when laid up. Assume that the shipowner is now offered a voyage business which takes 40 days and voyage-related costs of $400,000 in the period. On a total cost basis, the owner will require $880,000 in revenues. If the ship has a 44,000 DWT carrying capacity, this implies a rate of $20 per tonne of cargo delivered. But suppose the market rate is only $18. Should the shipowner lay up the ship?. If the shipowner lays up the ship, the shipowner faces extra costs of $40,000 (40 days x $1,000 lay-up costs per day). If shipowner takes business, shipowner gain $792,000 ($18 x 44,000 metric tons ) in extra revenues . But they spend operating costs of ($8,000 x 40 days) + $400,000 = $720,000. Therefore, the shipowner gains $72,000, compared to the loss of $40,000 resulting from lay-up. Shipowners should take a voyage charter business, even though the rate is less than the full cost of the trip. On the other hand, the same conclusion would be reached if the capital costs of $4,000 per day had been included. Here above example ignored any additional lay-up costs itself. Including lay-up costs would emphasize that trading will often take place at market rates which are less than the long-run costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to decide to lay up a ship, the shipowner should develop a model of the &lt;strong&gt;breakeven&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;level of freight rates&lt;/strong&gt; needed to maintain trading. Here above hypothetical lay-up example has implicitly assumed that the shipping company has &lt;strong&gt;one&lt;/strong&gt; ship in operation. On the other hand, a large number of dry shipowners operate large fleets. As the number of ships operated by a company increases, unit costs decrease. Tramp operators tend to have a higher proportion of their costs as &lt;strong&gt;variable costs&lt;/strong&gt; when compared to liner ship operators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The distinction between &lt;strong&gt;short-run&lt;/strong&gt; fixed and variable costs is &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; clear cut. &lt;strong&gt;Short-run&lt;/strong&gt; fixed and variable costs depend on:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;nature of the problem&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;type of ship&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;time period&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here above lay-up example, some items of &lt;strong&gt;daily operating costs&lt;/strong&gt; could be avoided (variable costs). On the other hand, if the shipowner was considering between two trading options, the entire daily running cost could &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; be avoided and becomes a fixed cost. Shorter the time period under consideration, the greater the proportion of costs that will be &lt;strong&gt;fixed costs&lt;/strong&gt;. Once a ship is at its loading berth (voyage is commenced), practically &lt;strong&gt;all costs&lt;/strong&gt; become &lt;strong&gt;fixed costs&lt;/strong&gt; (unavoidable).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Breakeven Analysis in Determining Minimum Freight Rates&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to determine the minimum freight rates, breakeven analysis is a very well-known method to present information on revenue and costs. In the breakeven analysis, the normal procedure is to calculate the &lt;strong&gt;load factor&lt;/strong&gt; (level of utilization) required to &lt;strong&gt;breakeven&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;point&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Profit: actual load factor (utilization level) exceeds the calculated number&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Loss: actual load factor (utilization level) below the calculated number&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In liner shipping, ships operate on a timetable and liner ships have to sail whether or not ships are fully loaded. Therefore, defining the load factor (utilization level) may well be significant in liner shipping. On the other hand, usually in dry bulk shipping, dry bulk ships are full cargo loaded (high utilization levels). Dry bulk ships do not operate on a timetable and sail whether or not they are fully loaded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of applying the model to working out the breakeven load factor, it can instead be employed to work out the &lt;strong&gt;breakeven rate.&lt;/strong&gt; The Breakeven rate is the freight rate which will ensure that a &lt;strong&gt;full cargo load&lt;/strong&gt; will generate sufficient &lt;strong&gt;revenue&lt;/strong&gt; to cover costs. Dry bulk freight rates are quite volatile. Therefore, it is useful to calculate the &lt;strong&gt;minimum freight rate&lt;/strong&gt; required to &lt;strong&gt;breakeven&lt;/strong&gt; the &lt;strong&gt;point&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Freight Rates Breakeven Analysis is based on the following assumptions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The basic unit of analysis is the ship&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Costs and revenues are assumed to be &lt;strong&gt;linear&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Plentiful market players. Shipowners and charterers &lt;strong&gt;cannot&lt;/strong&gt; influence the market freight rate on their own.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The actual freight rate is taken as fixed since no individual has any ability to alter freight rates. Market players are price takers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The slope of the Total Revenue line represents the market price; since total revenues rise in line with volume carried, the price is constant all the way along the Total Revenue line. Total fixed costs are the same, no matter what cargo quantity is loaded. Total variable costs are the difference between total costs and total fixed costs. At the cargo quantity level (Q) where &lt;strong&gt;total revenue&lt;/strong&gt; equals &lt;strong&gt;total cost&lt;/strong&gt; (Total Cost = Total Revenue = Equilibrium Point) is the &lt;strong&gt;Breakeven Freight Rate&lt;/strong&gt;. This cargo quantity (Q) is called the &lt;strong&gt;Breakeven Quantity&lt;/strong&gt; because it is at this point that total revenues cover both variable and fixed costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a shipping company, the &lt;strong&gt;lower&lt;/strong&gt; the proportion of &lt;strong&gt;variable costs&lt;/strong&gt; to &lt;strong&gt;fixed costs&lt;/strong&gt;, the greater the scope for the &lt;strong&gt;freight rate&lt;/strong&gt; to fall &lt;strong&gt;below&lt;/strong&gt; the &lt;strong&gt;long-run total cost&lt;/strong&gt;. This is one of the factors that explain the &lt;strong&gt;sharp&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;fluctuations&lt;/strong&gt; that are observed in freight rates in the dry cargo trades when contrasted with liner trades. Dry bulk companies have high variable costs, liner companies have high fixed costs. In depressed markets, dry bulk shipowners may well accept &lt;strong&gt;short-run trip charters&lt;/strong&gt; at rates well &lt;strong&gt;below&lt;/strong&gt; those required to cover their &lt;strong&gt;long-run costs&lt;/strong&gt;, if the proportion of variable costs are low.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Modeling Dry Cargo Shipping Market&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shipping market can be separated into specific segments. During modeling and analyzing the dry cargo shipping market, the following assumptions are made:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Each shipowner is seeking to &lt;strong&gt;maximize profits&lt;/strong&gt; (or minimize losses)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Each charterer is seeking the &lt;strong&gt;lowest freight rate&lt;/strong&gt; (consistent with an acceptable quality of service offered by the shipowner)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A large number of fixtures and all market participants are informed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Perfect competition&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a downward-sloping relationship between the &lt;strong&gt;cargo volumes&lt;/strong&gt; required to be moved and the level of &lt;strong&gt;freight rates&lt;/strong&gt;, other things being equal. The higher the freight rate, the smaller the demand for cargo movements and vice versa. Demand for dry cargo tonne-miles is a &lt;strong&gt;derived demand&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;strong&gt;Derived demand price elasticity&lt;/strong&gt; basic principles:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Final products’ price elasticity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Existence of close substitutes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The proportion of transport costs in the final product&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Derived demand price elasticity example: grain. Grain movements are driven by:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Production trends in different regions of the world&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Drought, weather conditions, and crop yields&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Changing patterns of food consumption&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grain is used to making bread, pasta. Furthermore, the grain is used to feed animals to produce meat. Final products such as bread, pasta, meat all have a &lt;strong&gt;low price elasticity&lt;/strong&gt; of demand. Most empirical evidence suggests that bread, pasta, meat are &lt;strong&gt;price inelastic&lt;/strong&gt;. Major grain exporters are located in South America, US Gulf, and Australia. Therefore, grain has to be moved by sea, because air transport is a very expensive alternative and not feasible. Currently, freight rates are about 6% of the final price of most traded commodities. Market demand is likely to be &lt;strong&gt;extremely inelastic&lt;/strong&gt; with respect to changes in freight rates. The shipping demand curve can be represented as an almost &lt;strong&gt;vertical line&lt;/strong&gt;. An extremely inelastic shipping market conclusion is for the shipping market as a &lt;strong&gt;whole&lt;/strong&gt;. In some trade routes, the demand on that route might be more sensitive to changes in that route’s freight rate. Shipowners always seek out trade routes that are more profitable. On the other hand, the ability to switch a ship from one route to another at relatively short notice implies that freight rates should not get too out of line with each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shipping Supply&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the dry bulk shipping business, under competitive conditions, shipowners &lt;strong&gt;should never&lt;/strong&gt; accept &lt;strong&gt;a freight rate&lt;/strong&gt; that is &lt;strong&gt;less&lt;/strong&gt; than the &lt;strong&gt;Average Variable Cost&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;(AVC)&lt;/strong&gt;. Furthermore, &lt;strong&gt;different ships have different costs&lt;/strong&gt;, because of different ages, flags, or crew costs. Assume that all average variable costs of all bulk carriers on the market were known and that a ranking could be organized starting with the dry cargo bulk ship with the lowest average variable cost to the highest. If shipping freight rates were high enough and cargo volumes large enough, all these dry bulk carriers would be employed. Now, if the shipping freight rate is steadily reduced, ships with high variable costs (avoidable) will cease trading first. As freight rate is lowered more, more dry bulk carriers are forced into idleness, until none is trading. &lt;strong&gt;Capital costs&lt;/strong&gt; should &lt;strong&gt;play no role&lt;/strong&gt; in the &lt;strong&gt;lay-up decision&lt;/strong&gt; in the &lt;strong&gt;short run&lt;/strong&gt; since capital costs have to be met whether or not the ship is being traded. Older ships will tend to have higher operating costs than newer ships, so the majority of laid-up ships are the older ships of the fleets. In the short-run period, ships’ variable costs can be altered by varying the ship’s speed. Lower ship speed means lower output and lower costs. When demand is low and so freight rates are low, the loss of shipping output is more than offset by the benefits of &lt;strong&gt;slow steaming&lt;/strong&gt;. The shipping supply curve becomes steeper in slope as maximum tonne-mile production is attained. Because:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Additional tonne-miles being created near full capacity are being created by the more inefficient ships in the fleet the ones with &lt;strong&gt;higher variable costs&lt;/strong&gt;. High variable cost ships add a lot to costs without adding that much extra to output&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Speed increases are a limited way of raising output. Extra costs of fuel consumption increase more rapidly than the extra output&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shipping supply curve eventually becomes &lt;strong&gt;vertical&lt;/strong&gt; which represents the notion of &lt;strong&gt;full capacity utilization&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;strong&gt;In the short term&lt;/strong&gt;, no more shipping output can be obtained from the &lt;strong&gt;existing fleet&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Equilibrium Freight Rate&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shipping market is defined as the interaction of supply and demand. Demand and supply both together determine the &lt;strong&gt;equilibrium freight rate&lt;/strong&gt; (P) and quantities (Q) moved at that freight rate. Shipping demand conditions are affected by the volume of world trade, which is driven by overall economic activity, and changing degrees of openness towards trade by individual nations. As demand volumes increase, there is a relatively small rise in the market freight rate and a large rise in tonne-miles produced at the beginning. But, as demand volumes keep increasing, the increase in demand is translated into large increases in freight rates, because supply is very limited supply becomes very &lt;strong&gt;inelastic&lt;/strong&gt;. This model can be used to examine &lt;strong&gt;short-run&lt;/strong&gt; fluctuations in shipping market conditions, but &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; the &lt;strong&gt;long-run&lt;/strong&gt; period. Because, in the &lt;strong&gt;short-run&lt;/strong&gt; period, the existing stock of ships is limited. But, in the &lt;strong&gt;long-run&lt;/strong&gt; period, altering the stock of ships (newbuilding and scrapped ships) shifts the equilibrium point. In the short-run period, when demand increase, freight rates move up very sharply and supply does &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; increase much. Existing shipowners make large profits and this situation encourages shipowners to &lt;strong&gt;order new ships&lt;/strong&gt;. In the second-hand market, the value of existing ships also rises. Shipping market players expect that profits are going to be healthy in the future. Increased number of newbuilding orders will translate into a rightward shift in the supply curve in the &lt;strong&gt;long term&lt;/strong&gt; and this will lead to a &lt;strong&gt;fall&lt;/strong&gt; in freight rates if demand remains the same. In the short-run period, when demand decrease, this situation cause reduction in supply and a rise in ship &lt;strong&gt;lay-ups&lt;/strong&gt;. In the short-run period, when some ships will be trading at freight rates which do &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; cover full costs. Operating slightly below variable costs is acceptable in the &lt;strong&gt;short-term&lt;/strong&gt;, but it is &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; sustainable in the long-term. Therefore, some ships will be laid up or scrapped. The scrapping of ships leads to help raise freight rates if the supply shifts far enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Higher or lower &lt;strong&gt;freight rates&lt;/strong&gt; create incentives to increase or to decrease &lt;strong&gt;tonne-miles&lt;/strong&gt; supplied through the following mechanisms:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;higher or lower freight rates encourage a higher or slower ship &lt;strong&gt;speed&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;higher or lower freight rates will encourage shipowners with &lt;strong&gt;high variable cost ships&lt;/strong&gt; to scrap or lay-up&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;strong&gt;long-run&lt;/strong&gt; period, &lt;strong&gt;fluctuations&lt;/strong&gt; in freight rates and lay-up numbers encourage shipowners to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Embrace or reject newbuilding orders&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Progress or delay scrapping ships&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Expectation of Shipowners&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A key factor influencing shipowners’ decision to scrap or order new ships is the expectations of &lt;strong&gt;future levels of freight demand&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;freight rates. Future&lt;/strong&gt; expectation is crucial in determining how the shipping market reacts to short-term changes in demand and freight rate levels. If shipowners are &lt;strong&gt;optimistic&lt;/strong&gt; about the future freight rates and demand, falling rates in the short term may &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; lead to a longer-term reduction in shipping capacity. If shipowners are &lt;strong&gt;pessimistic&lt;/strong&gt; about the future freight rates and demand, any short-term market downturns may lead to a shortage of capacity if demand grows at an unexpected place. Shipowners’ future expectations can be very &lt;strong&gt;volatile&lt;/strong&gt;. Volatility helps to explain the sudden increases and sudden falls of freight rates, particularly when political events, wars, or other events can have strategic impacts on dry cargo markets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here above fright rate model implies:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A strong positive correlation&lt;/strong&gt; between demand growth and new orders when the present stock of ships is highly utilized with low levels of lay-up&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Freight rates should be sensitive to &lt;strong&gt;short-run market conditions&lt;/strong&gt;. Freight rates reflect both present market and future expectations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exceptional events&lt;/strong&gt; such as wars, political event, embargoes, closure of canals generate significant increases in freight rates when the present stock of ships is highly utilized&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A strong positive correlation between freight rates and new orders, with periods of high rates associated with higher than average orders, lower than average lay-ups, and scrapping&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the period between 1947-1984, based on a notional value of 100 for 1965, &lt;strong&gt;without&lt;/strong&gt; inflation effects, later shipping booms would look &lt;strong&gt;larger&lt;/strong&gt; and the earlier shipping booms look &lt;strong&gt;smaller&lt;/strong&gt;. There are substantial periods of demand growth in which freight rates do &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; fluctuate all that dramatically. In these flat periods:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Plenty of ship capacity available to meet any increase in demand&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Expansion of demand is matched by the correct expansion of capacity, brought about by accurate expectations generating the correct level of ordering&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shipping &lt;strong&gt;spikes&lt;/strong&gt; are generated by &lt;strong&gt;external events&lt;/strong&gt; that are &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; completely &lt;strong&gt;anticipated&lt;/strong&gt; by the shipping market. Shipping &lt;strong&gt;spikes&lt;/strong&gt; are generated by &lt;strong&gt;external events&lt;/strong&gt; such as wars or war-related events. For example, the 1973 shipping crises. Growth in demand for shipping services was very high in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Many shipowners ordered new large ships. However, in September 1973, the shipping boom came to a halt with the six-day Arab-Israeli war. Suez Canal closed and the Arab oil embargo on countries seen as pro-Israel triggered a 400% rise in the price of crude oil delivered a huge shock to the Western economies that had been previously growing quite rapidly. Western economies’ growth faltered and income fell in 1974. Lower economic growth means lower growth in the demand for shipping.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shipping rate peaks of &lt;strong&gt;1970&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;1973&lt;/strong&gt; correspond to two of the years of highest annual growth of &lt;strong&gt;tonne-mile&lt;/strong&gt; demand:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1970 Annual tonne-mile demand growth &lt;strong&gt;3%&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1973 Annual tonne-mile demand growth &lt;strong&gt;2%&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shipping demand actually fell by &lt;strong&gt;2.3%&lt;/strong&gt; in 1975. In 1984, demand grew at &lt;strong&gt;10.2%&lt;/strong&gt;, but there is &lt;strong&gt;no&lt;/strong&gt; peak in the freight rates in 1984. The difference in the two situations is due to laid-up tonnage. In 1970 and 1973, very little tonnage was laid-up. However, in 1984, over 20% of the fleet was laid up. In 1984, an increase in demand was easily met from existing ship capacity and &lt;strong&gt;no peak&lt;/strong&gt; in freight rates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1970 and 1973 peaks, demand is at or near full ship capacity, so further increases triggered to generate large freight rate increases as supply response was very small. But, in 1984, there was plenty of spare capacity and significant increases in demand were met with &lt;strong&gt;no&lt;/strong&gt; corresponding rise in freight rates. The shipping volatility index, based on 1985 = 100, shows that the average freight rate has risen sharply since 2003, and so the volatility of the freight rate. The dramatic change in the shipping market has been since 2003. Since 2003, intra-year shipping volatility jumps from around 3% to figures which range between &lt;strong&gt;14%&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;33%&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dramatic increase in freight rates and volatility between 2003-2008:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tonne-mile&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;demand&lt;/strong&gt; rose at a remarkable rate between 2003-2008 (over 6% per year)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fleet capacity did not grow as fast, ships have to work harder and freight rates spiked&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An increase in freight rates did &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; solve the problem&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gross profit margins were very large&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Between 2003-2008, such huge earnings caused the &lt;strong&gt;scrapping&lt;/strong&gt; of dry cargo ships to more or less &lt;strong&gt;disappear&lt;/strong&gt; and generated a &lt;strong&gt;record number of newbuilding orders&lt;/strong&gt;. Future freight rates are therefore being affected by the delivery of new tonnage and prospective future demand growth. The dramatic increase in freight rates also affected the price of &lt;strong&gt;secondhand tonnage&lt;/strong&gt; and secondhand prices became very high. Between 2003-2008, in certain cases, a secondhand ship became more expensive than its newbuild equivalent due to delivery time. This is called &lt;strong&gt;ready ship premium&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reasons for a dramatic increase in freight rates and volatility between 2003-2008:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In 2001, &lt;strong&gt;China&lt;/strong&gt; entered the WTO (World Trade Organization). China became a major player in international trade. China’s economy has grown at &lt;strong&gt;10%&lt;/strong&gt; per year compound for many years. China’s demand for &lt;strong&gt;steel&lt;/strong&gt; China became the &lt;strong&gt;world’s largest steel producer&lt;/strong&gt; which increased the demand for steel shipping&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Production of &lt;strong&gt;steel&lt;/strong&gt; requires &lt;strong&gt;iron ore&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;coking coal&lt;/strong&gt;. China’s demand for both iron ore and coal rose dramatically&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rapid &lt;strong&gt;growth in world trade&lt;/strong&gt; has stimulated increased manufacturing. Manufacturing triggered the demand for raw materials and also trade has been liberalized.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Many other economies have grown rapidly such as India&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shortages&lt;/strong&gt; of suitable ships caused to move cargoes into two bottoms. Shortage of ship supply as cargo demand shifted. Transportation costs rose.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dynamic Shipping Model&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here above freight rate model concentrated upon demand and supply conditions. The only additional factor is the role of &lt;strong&gt;shipowners’ future expectations&lt;/strong&gt;. Shipowners’ future expectations help to determine shipowners’ ordering, scrapping, and operational decisions. In order to determine the shipowners’ future expectations, we need to look at past events. Historical data and recent trends can be projected forward to estimate the shipowners’ future expectations as to future demand conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Newbuilding ordering in the early 1970s can be seen as a response to the widely-held view that the market was going to continue to grow as rapidly in the second half of the 1970s as it did till 1973.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a shipowner anticipates a prosperous period, the shipowner needs to order as early as possible, because newbuilding ship construction takes around two years if there is an available slot at the shipyards. There are two possible outcomes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Shipowner’s future expectations are fulfilled, shipping demand grows as every shipping market player is expected it to and the capacity is met&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Shipowner’s future expectations turn out to be incorrect and the unexpected happens. New ships have been ordered and a large number of them have been delivered. The shipping market is oversupplied.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1973, shipping market conditions were a nightmare for shipowners but profitable for charterers. The shipping market was in turmoil with large numbers of ships and little growth in shipping demand. In 2010, a similar situation occurred, following the 2008 financial crisis. Annual deliveries of new bulk carriers continued to &lt;strong&gt;increase until 2011&lt;/strong&gt; when 97.7 million DWT was delivered. The scrapping of dry bulk ships also increased, peaking in &lt;strong&gt;2012&lt;/strong&gt; at 32.5 million DWT. The key difference between the 1970s and 2010s shipping crises is that &lt;strong&gt;laid-up&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;idle tonnage&lt;/strong&gt; remained at &lt;strong&gt;low levels&lt;/strong&gt; in 2010s, with shipowners opting to &lt;strong&gt;slow steam&lt;/strong&gt; in order to absorb some of the surplus tonnages. Dry freight markets continue to be depressed since 2012, notwithstanding seasonal and other temporary improvements. In both cases, the 1970s and 2010s shipping crises, a contributory factor to the &lt;strong&gt;over-ordering&lt;/strong&gt; of newbuilding ships are that &lt;strong&gt;shipping finance&lt;/strong&gt; was widely &lt;strong&gt;available&lt;/strong&gt; during a period of growth and high freight rates. Estimating demand and supply conditions in the &lt;strong&gt;next decade&lt;/strong&gt; would therefore make &lt;strong&gt;very little sense&lt;/strong&gt; if an analyst just examined demand and supply in the &lt;strong&gt;current year.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The current shipping supply available is the consequence of past decisions by shipowners&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shipping market players never really learn from previous mistakes and keep ordering new ships. Overbuilding will impact on earnings in all shipping markets. The crucial factor is to order early and not to be the last shipowner to order. In the shipping business, once freight rates increase and the shipping market starts to move, other shipowners join in and herd behavior will eventually result in tonnage oversupply. Therefore, the shipping market generates its own &lt;strong&gt;dynamic behavior model&lt;/strong&gt; over time, as the shipping market continually &lt;strong&gt;readjusts&lt;/strong&gt; to new demand conditions. Poor market conditions influence newbuilding decisions and orders became relatively scarce. On the other hand, if demand conditions alter for the better this lack of new investment may itself generate &lt;strong&gt;another shipping cycle&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dry cargo markets appear to move through &lt;strong&gt;cycles&lt;/strong&gt; of boom, recession, slump, recovery, and back to boom again. Shipping cycles are partly generated by the &lt;strong&gt;cyclical growth in shipping demand&lt;/strong&gt;. However, shipping cycles are also a result of the fact that &lt;strong&gt;supply adjustment is a slow&lt;/strong&gt; process. Shipping analysts have suggested that there are cycles of different periods observable in the shipping market. These different shipping cycles are &lt;strong&gt;overlaying&lt;/strong&gt; each other. Seasonal pattern of demand as being the shortest cycle. On top of that, world demand growth appears to cycle over 5-7 years. Ship supply cycles are longer, on average 13 years. On top of that, very long cyclical patterns of around 50 years. Viewing the shipping market as a dynamic model, as a process in which demand conditions and supply responses change over time, gives a much richer picture of the way the shipping market operates. In sum, ship supply responds to a change in demand, often spread out over several periods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Freight rates are the outcome of a &lt;strong&gt;bargaining process&lt;/strong&gt;, based on their &lt;strong&gt;expectations of future&lt;/strong&gt; demand and supply, rather than simply the balance of supply and demand at a particular place and time. Shipowners and charterers form expectations of future freight rates and &lt;strong&gt;bargain&lt;/strong&gt; over the &lt;strong&gt;deviation&lt;/strong&gt; of future rates from the latest fixture. The final outcome is influenced by the relative bargaining power of each shipowner and charterer. If the &lt;strong&gt;charterer&lt;/strong&gt; has more power freight rate deviation will be &lt;strong&gt;lower&lt;/strong&gt; than latest fixture. If the &lt;strong&gt;shipowner&lt;/strong&gt; has more power freight rate deviation will be &lt;strong&gt;higher&lt;/strong&gt; than the latest fixture. Many factors can affect the relative bargaining power of shipowners and charterers, but &lt;strong&gt;economic conditions&lt;/strong&gt; are the single most important factor in most situations. In &lt;strong&gt;improving&lt;/strong&gt; economic conditions, &lt;strong&gt;shipowners&lt;/strong&gt; have bargaining power. In &lt;strong&gt;worsening&lt;/strong&gt; economic conditions, &lt;strong&gt;charterers&lt;/strong&gt; have the bargaining power. In bargaining power, &lt;strong&gt;information&lt;/strong&gt; is also an important factor especially when information is comprehensive, accurate, timely, and cheap. Therefore, the role of the &lt;strong&gt;shipbroker&lt;/strong&gt; is crucial in central to the discussion on bargaining between shipowners and charterers. Despite all the improvements in communications and technology, shipbrokers continue to have a role in &lt;strong&gt;assimilating information&lt;/strong&gt; for shipowners and charterers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dry Bulk Chartering&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;dry-bulk-chartering&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#dry-bulk-chartering&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is Ship Chartering?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;what-is-ship-chartering&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#what-is-ship-chartering&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chartering refers to the act of contracting a vessel or a portion of a vessel for the transportation of goods by sea. This may occur on any type of vessel and for any type of cargo, including bulk, general, or specialized cargo, among others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chartering plays a crucial role in the shipping industry and is central to its economic framework. The Ship Chartering Market is comprised of Shipowners seeking to charter out tonnage and Charterers looking to charter in tonnage for transportation services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The demand for shipping arises from the need to transport cargo on behalf of Shippers and Traders. This demand is satisfied by the Chartering Market, which manages the transportation requirements. Shipowners seeking to fill ship capacity with cargo will do so through the Chartering Market. Additionally, the Ship Chartering Market caters to the needs of Ship Operators, who may not possess cargo per se but operate ships and offer shipping services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The complex and efficient Ship Chartering Process can fulfill the demand for ship transport. It begins with the parties in need of tonnage and is executed by the Shipowner who provides that capacity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Ship Chartering Market connects the supply of ships in the global merchant fleet with the demand for seaborne trade. It caters to the transportation needs of all types of seaborne cargo and ships.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Dry Cargo Market and the Tanker Market experience the most intense ship chartering activity. Other types of ships can also be chartered by Ship Operators and Charterers requiring specialized transportation capacity, but chartering activity in these markets tends to be less intense due to the prevalence of long-term chartering contracts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ship chartering process is facilitated by the Shipbroker, who acts on behalf of the Principal (Shipowner or Charterer). The Shipbroker is a skilled individual with experience in the ship chartering process, as well as a network of contacts and associates instrumental in efficiently executing it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Shipbroker communicates relevant information and receives information on ship positions and cargoes, analyzing all data. Additionally, the Shipbroker assists in Chartering Negotiations, which entail the placement of cargo orders and ship positions by Charterers and Shipowners, respectively, and the exchange of offers and counteroffers until an agreement is reached. Following the chartering negotiations and agreement, the Shipbroker may be responsible for drafting the Charterparty (a maritime contract between a Shipowner and a Charterer) agreed upon by the parties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ship will sail on the agreed routes or be placed at the disposal of the Charterer for a Voyage Charter or Time Charter. In a Voyage Charter, the Charterer must pay Freight, while in a Time Charter, the Charterer is obligated to pay Hire. Shipbrokers may also engage in post-fixture work or work related to the performance of the Charterparty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are the main types of Ship Chartering?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;what-are-the-main-types-of-ship-chartering&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#what-are-the-main-types-of-ship-chartering&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Merchant vessels are in existence for the purpose of transporting cargoes. With the exception of certain oil companies, ship owners have little proprietary interest in the goods being transported by their ships. Consequently, they rely on others to hire or charter their ships to generate income. The two principal forms of ship chartering are Voyage Charter and Time Charter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under Voyage Charter, the ship is chartered to transport cargo from a designated port or ports and transport it to another specified port of discharge, or a range of discharge ports, in exchange for the payment of freight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, under Time Charter, the charterer hires the ship for a predetermined period of time, and pays hire for each day, hour, and minute that the ship is at their disposal. The most widely used dry cargo time charter is the New York Produce Exchange Form (1946).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is Voyage Charter?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;what-is-voyage-charter&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#what-is-voyage-charter&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Voyage Charter or Spot Charter involves engaging a ship for a single voyage, where the vessel is tasked to transport cargo from a specific load port or ports to a discharge port or ports within a mutually agreed area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Shipowner bears the responsibility for all operational expenses of the ship, including additional expenses incurred during the voyage, such as port charges and bunkers, with the exception of cargo-handling expenses, which are generally covered by the charterer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In dry bulk chartering, some charterparties may specify overtime costs for loading or unloading the cargo, including who is responsible for paying the additional charges. Typically, the crew members are under the Shipowner’s responsibility, while the charterer is responsible for compensating the stevedores.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, in tanker chartering, the issue of cost does not arise, as the cargo is pumped into the ship by the shore and, therefore, the shipper effectively covers the expenses. The ship’s pumps are then utilized to discharge the cargo, which incurs a cost for the Shipowner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;**What is Voyage Charterparty? **&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;what-is-voyage-charterparty&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#what-is-voyage-charterparty&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Voyage Charterparty constitutes a contract between the Shipowner and a Charterer who seeks the services of a vessel. The primary aim of this agreement is to procure the use of a ship and its crew to transport a consignment of goods from one port to another on behalf of the charterer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In exchange for providing the vessel to the charterer, the owner receives Freight, and in certain cases, demurrage. Freight refers to the compensation earned by the owner for providing the vessel and carrying the charterer’s cargo. The amount of Freight is typically determined by the quantity of cargo loaded and will be negotiated based on the owner’s estimate of the time required for the voyage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the Shipowner cannot accurately predict the time that the vessel will spend in port loading and discharging cargo. Consequently, a fixed period known as Laytime is allowed for these operations, and provision is made for the payment of liquidated damages in case the laytime period is exceeded, which is referred to as Demurrage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From an English legal perspective, there is no prescribed form that the Voyage Charterparty must adhere to. In fact, this agreement may even be oral and need not be in writing. However, given the potential uncertainty and misunderstanding that oral agreements can give rise to, written contracts are preferred, and various Standard Form Voyage Charterparties have been developed and are commonly utilized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the realm of dry bulk chartering, the GENCON Voyage Charterparty is a widely employed contract.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is Freight?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;what-is-freight&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#what-is-freight&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the context of Voyage Chartering, Freight refers to the compensation paid by the Charterer to the Shipowner for the conveyance of cargo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Typically, the Freight can be paid in one of two ways – either on a per-tonne basis or as a Lump Sum. The payment is usually made upon the delivery of the cargo for tanker shipments or upon the signing of Bills of Lading for dry cargo shipments. In some cases, the payment may be split between these two events, with a portion paid after the signing of Bills of Lading and the remaining portion paid upon the actual delivery of the cargo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the domain of tanker chartering, Worldscale is utilized to calculate the Freight. This method implies that the Freight amount is not finalized until the discharge port is nominated. In such instances, the quantity of cargo to be loaded is agreed upon beforehand, and the Charterer generally provides a full cargo. However, as the Shipowner is uncertain about the exact capacity of the ship at this stage, it is usually described as a given tonnage with a fixed percentage MOLOO (More or Less in Owners’ Option) or MOLCHOP/MOLCHOPT (More or Less in Charterers’ Option). While using the abbreviation MOLCO is not advisable, as the handwritten version can be too similar to its opposite, MOLOO. For instance, if a shipment is described as 100,000 tonnes 10% MOLOO, it means that the Shipowner can load up to 110,000 tonnes or a minimum of 90,000 tonnes. On arriving at the loading port, the Ship Master calculates the bunkers, constants, and draft restrictions to determine the precise quantity of cargo the ship can load.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is Charterparty?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;what-is-charterparty&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#what-is-charterparty&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the realm of dry cargo markets, the majority of shipping agreements concern the transportation of voluminous, unprocessed materials. The conventional mode of conveyance for such raw bulk materials is known as the charterparty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The term “charterparty” is derived from the Latin phrase carta partita, meaning “split paper,” referring to a document that is duplicated so that each party retains a copy. In certain legal texts pertaining to shipping, the expression “Contract of Affreightment” (CoA) is used in place of the term “Contract of Carriage” (Charterparty).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is COA (Contract of Affreightment)?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;what-is-coa-contract-of-affreightment&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#what-is-coa-contract-of-affreightment&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The term “Contract of Affreightment” is a more precise means of denoting the conveyance of goods by sea, and within the maritime community, it has taken on a particular connotation as a specific type of agreement. These agreements, known as COAs, are employed when a ship operator or owner commits to transporting a specified quantity of goods during a predetermined time frame.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is the difference between COA (Contract of Affreightment and Charterparty?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;what-is-the-difference-between-coa-contract-of-affreightment-and-charterparty&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#what-is-the-difference-between-coa-contract-of-affreightment-and-charterparty&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Charterparty is a contractual agreement entered into by a Shipowner and a Charterer. In this agreement, the Shipowner commits to either transporting cargo for the Charterer on their vessel or granting the Charterer access to the entire or part of the vessel’s hold for the purpose of cargo carriage on a designated voyage or multiple voyages, or for a specific time period (as in the case of a Time Charter).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, a Contract of Affreightment (COA) is another type of agreement between a Shipowner and a Charterer. A COA is typically used when the Shipowner or Ship Operator agrees to transport a particular quantity of cargo over a predetermined period of time. Unlike a Charterparty, the COA does not stipulate a specific vessel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a Contract of Affreightment, the responsibility of delivering ships as per the project’s requirements lies with the Shipowner or Ship Operator. This grants them considerable freedom to manage their fleet to their advantage. Additionally, the Shipowner or Ship Operator may hire additional vessels if their fleet is already occupied with more profitable work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is the difference between COA (Contract of Affreightment and Charterparty?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;what-is-the-difference-between-coa-contract-of-affreightment-and-charterparty-1&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#what-is-the-difference-between-coa-contract-of-affreightment-and-charterparty-1&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Contract of Affreightment (COA) and a Charterparty are both agreements related to the transportation of goods via a vessel, but they differ in terms of scope, nature, and duration. Here are the key differences between the two:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scope:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Contract of Affreightment (COA): A COA is an agreement between a shipper (cargo owner) and a carrier (ship owner) for the transportation of a specific quantity of cargo over a period of time. The contract covers multiple voyages or shipments, and the carrier is responsible for providing the required vessel capacity to transport the agreed-upon cargo.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Charterparty: A Charterparty is a contract between a shipowner and a charterer (the party hiring the vessel) for the use of a vessel or its cargo space. It can be for a single voyage (Voyage Charter) or for a specific period (Time Charter). The charterer typically has more control over the vessel, deciding the ports, routes, and cargo.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;2&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Duration:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Contract of Affreightment (COA): A COA generally covers a longer period, ranging from several months to a few years, depending on the agreed-upon terms. It is more focused on the long-term transportation of goods.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Charterparty: The duration of a Charterparty depends on the type of charter. A Voyage Charter lasts for a single voyage, whereas a Time Charter can last for a specific period, typically ranging from a few months to several years.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;3&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Payment:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Contract of Affreightment (COA): The payment in a COA is usually based on the volume of cargo transported, referred to as the freight rate. This rate can be fixed or flexible, depending on the terms of the agreement.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Charterparty: In a Voyage Charter, the payment is based on the cargo quantity, while in a Time Charter, the payment is based on the daily hire rate for the vessel, which is agreed upon between the shipowner and the charterer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;4&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Flexibility and control:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Contract of Affreightment (COA): In a COA, the carrier has more control over the vessel, deciding the routes and scheduling to fulfill their obligation to transport the cargo. The shipper has limited control over the vessel.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Charterparty: The charterer has more control over the vessel, deciding the ports, routes, and cargo. In a Time Charter, the charterer may even select the crew and manage the vessel’s daily operations, with some limitations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contract of Affreightment (COA) is an agreement for the transportation of a specific quantity of cargo over a period of time, while a Charterparty is a contract for the use of a vessel or its cargo space, either for a single voyage or a specific period. The main differences lie in the scope, duration, payment, and level of control each party has over the vessel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is Ship Chartering Contract?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;what-is-ship-chartering-contract&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#what-is-ship-chartering-contract&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the realm of ship chartering, the Ship Chartering Contract stands out as a prime example of a transaction solely driven by the forces of the shipping market. This type of contract is typically negotiated within a free market environment and is subject exclusively to the laws of supply and demand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The relative bargaining power of Shipowners and Charterers is heavily influenced by the prevailing conditions of the shipping market. As a result, the Charterparty Terms are negotiated freely without any interference from statutory regulations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In practice, Shipowners and Charterers commonly utilize a customary Standard Charterparty Form that has been developed specifically for their business. This Standard Charterparty Form is often customized with additional clauses known as Rider Clauses. Depending on the current state of the shipping market, intense negotiations may ensue between Shipowners and Charterers over these Charterparty Amendments, as well as the Freight, Hire, Demurrage, and Despatch Money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is Chartering Fixture?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;what-is-chartering-fixture&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#what-is-chartering-fixture&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;When a Charterer requires the services of a ship, they engage the services of Shipbrokers and provide comprehensive information such as cargo details, loading and discharging ports, freight estimates, and the terms of the charterparty. This process is commonly referred to as an Invitation to Treat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Shipowner, through their Shipbroker, responds with an Offer that includes crucial details such as the ship’s name, flag, year of construction, class, equipment for cargo handling, among other pertinent details. The Offer also outlines the last three cargoes, cargo intake levels, loading and discharging rates, freight rates, laydays/canceling days, estimated time of arrival, ship position, demurrage, charterparty, and other specific terms such as SHEX (Sundays and Holidays Excluded) or SHINC (Sundays and Holidays Included), eco speeds, commission, and the time limit for the offer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Shipowner’s offer is conveyed to the Charterer through the Shipbroker, and if it’s communicated verbally, it will be followed by a telex or email. The use of telex is still prevalent in countries that recognize it since it features an answerback function that provides evidence of when the offer was received by the recipient, which is crucial in establishing whether the offer was timely or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alternatively, the offer can be sent via email, followed by a phone call to confirm its receipt. The Charterer can choose to Reject, Accept, Counter, Accept Except (A/E), or Accept on Subjects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Ship chartering negotiations continue with both parties making Counter-Offers until they agree on the details and terms of the charter, except for the subjects. Under English Law, there is no valid Charterparty (Shipping Contract) until all the subjects are lifted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, after all the subjects are lifted, the negotiated terms are documented in the Charterparty. While waiting for the subjects to be lifted and before the Charterparty is drafted, the Shipbroker will send a Recapitulation message to both parties, summarizing all the points agreed upon during the chartering negotiations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, the Shipowner and Charterer verify their messages and corrections to confirm that the Charterparty reflects what was agreed upon during the chartering negotiations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chartering Fixture is the term used to indicate that the Charterparty (Shipping Contract) has been established, and the negotiations to charter the ship have been completed.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In some instances, to save time, a Chartering Fixture may be made based on the previous one. In other words, the terms and conditions agreed upon in the previous Chartering Fixture will be repeated, with certain exceptions. Therefore, both parties must be clear on what this means.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a Shipbroker is authorized to sign a Charterparty (Shipping Contract) on behalf of their Principal (Shipowner or Charterer), they should indicate the source of authority, such as telephone, telex, facsimile, or email authority of the Principal’s name As Agents Only. The fundamental rule is that with a signature qualified in this way, a Shipbroker will not be held personally liable for the performance of the Charterparty (Shipping Contract). If the name of the Principal (Shipowner or Charterer) is not disclosed, then even the qualification of As Agents Only would not exonerate the Shipbroker from liability for the performance of the Charterparty (Shipping Contract).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is STEM&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;in Ship Chartering?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;what-is-stem-in-ship-chartering&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#what-is-stem-in-ship-chartering&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;STEM stands for &lt;strong&gt;Subject To Enough Merchandise&lt;/strong&gt;, indicating the condition that must be met before proceeding with the shipment. The purpose of STEM is to allow Charterers sufficient time to present the vessel to the Shippers and verify that they can accommodate the agreed-upon amount of cargo on the agreed-upon laydays. STEM is intended solely for determining cargo availability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is STEM (Subject To Enough Merchandise) in Ship Chartering?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;what-is-stem-subject-to-enough-merchandise-in-ship-chartering&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#what-is-stem-subject-to-enough-merchandise-in-ship-chartering&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;In ship chartering, the term STEM (Subject To Enough Merchandise) is used when a vessel’s departure or arrival for loading or discharging cargo is contingent upon the availability of sufficient cargo. This term is often included in charter party agreements, which are contracts outlining the terms and conditions for the use of a vessel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a charter agreement includes the term “STEM,” it signifies that the vessel’s readiness to load or discharge cargo is subject to the charterer having enough merchandise available at the port or terminal. If the charterer does not have the required amount of cargo, the vessel may not be obligated to commence loading or discharging operations, and the laytime (the time allowed for loading or discharging cargo) may not start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The inclusion of STEM in a charter party agreement helps to protect the interests of both the ship owner and the charterer. For the ship owner, it ensures that the vessel is not left waiting at a port without cargo, which can be expensive due to port charges and idle time. For the charterer, it provides flexibility in managing the logistics of their cargo and the timing of its arrival at the port or terminal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is essential for both parties to clearly define the conditions and requirements related to STEM in their charter party agreement to avoid any potential disputes or misunderstandings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is STEM IN ORDER in Ship Chartering?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;what-is-stem-in-order-in-ship-chartering&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#what-is-stem-in-order-in-ship-chartering&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;In ship chartering, the term “STEM IN ORDER” (Subject To Enough Merchandise) is used to indicate that the departure, arrival, or loading of a vessel is conditional upon the availability of sufficient cargo. This term is often included in charter party agreements, which outline the terms and conditions for the use of a vessel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a charter party agreement includes “STEM IN ORDER,” it means that the vessel’s readiness to load or discharge cargo is dependent on the charterer having enough merchandise available at the port or terminal. If the required amount of cargo is not available, the vessel may not be obligated to commence loading or discharging operations, and the laytime (the time allowed for loading or discharging cargo) may not start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The inclusion of “STEM IN ORDER” in a charter party agreement helps protect the interests of both the ship owner and the charterer. For the ship owner, it ensures that the vessel is not left waiting at a port without cargo, which can be costly due to port charges and idle time. For the charterer, it provides flexibility in managing the logistics of their cargo and the timing of its arrival at the port or terminal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both parties must clearly define the conditions and requirements related to “STEM IN ORDER” in their charter party agreement to prevent any potential disputes or misunderstandings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ship Chartering Contracts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;ship-chartering-contracts&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#ship-chartering-contracts&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is feasible to establish a legally binding Ship Chartering Contract (Charter Party Form) through verbal communication. It is within the realm of possibility to charter a ship via an oral telephone conversation. There exists precedent demonstrating that a ship can be chartered orally, although this practice is not typically employed in the commercial shipping industry. The validity of an oral charter and the provisions included in the charter party will depend on the application of local contract law with regard to the formation of a contract.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The form of Ship Chartering and the terms of the Charter Party may vary to some extent, contingent upon the nature of the cargo and the type of vessel involved. Each specialized trade may pose unique legal challenges and may follow distinct industry practices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Charter Party Forms commonly utilized in the industry can vary by trade, some examples of which are as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GENCON for Dry Bulk Ships&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;BIMCHEMTIME for Chemical Tankers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;BOXTIME 2004 for Container Ships&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;NYPE (New York Produce Exchange) for Dry Bulk Ships&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;lntertanko for Tankers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

    &lt;a href=&#34;#where-can-i-find-a-charter-party-form&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;We kindly suggest that you visit the web page of BIMCO (Baltic and International Maritime Council) and ASBA (Association of Ship Brokers and Agents) to obtain the original Charter Party forms and documents. &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.bimco.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;www.bimco.org&lt;/a&gt;  and  &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.asba.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;www.asba.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is Bareboat Charter?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;what-is-bareboat-charter&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#what-is-bareboat-charter&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The concept of Bareboat Charter is based on the idea that the shipowner has effectively relinquished complete control and possession of the ship to the charterer. This type of charter involves the transfer of control and possession of the ship. When examining a Bareboat charter, courts will likely consider the charter itself, as well as any relevant facts and circumstances, to determine whether the shipowner retains any rights or responsibilities with respect to the ship, such as the right or responsibility to supply the crew or arrange for ship insurance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In contrast, a space charter, lot charter, or part cargo charter involves only a portion of the ship’s cargo capacity being chartered, rather than the entire ship. These types of charters are typically between ocean common carriers who may charter space from each other to meet customer commitments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a Bareboat Charter is in effect, the charterer acts as if they are the shipowner, assuming both responsibility for the ship’s operation and liability limitation rights that the owner may have. For example, under the United States Shipowner’s Limitation of Liability Act, the shipowner is generally permitted to limit its liability to third parties arising from the operation of the ship to the value of the ship and pending freight at the end of the voyage in which the incident occurred either when the ship reaches port, or if the ship is lost, at the time of the loss. This same right is expressly granted to a charterer that mans, supplies, and navigates a ship at their own expense or by their own procurement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The existence of a Bareboat Charter is also an essential element under United States law with respect to whether a non-citizen financial institution or leasing company may own a U.S. flagship engaged in the United States coastwise trade operated by a qualified United States citizen pursuant to a Bareboat Charter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a ship is chartered out as bareboat, the shipowner generally will not be liable to third parties harmed through the operation of the ship. The Bareboat charterer assumes responsibility for any third-party claims. However, maritime law treats a ship itself as a person (in rem), so a third-party plaintiff may seek recovery against both the bareboat charterer and the ship. As a result, unless the shipowner has an effective way to obtain indemnification from the bareboat charterer for claims against the ship, the shipowner may still be exposed to some risk of liability to third parties. Such indemnification provisions are typically found in bareboat charter forms and are supported by associated liability insurance requirements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One exception to the general rule is where the shipowner takes steps to operate the ship itself, either directly or through an agent, in situations such as when the bareboat charterer has defaulted. In such a case, the shipowner may become the de facto ship operator and may be liable for any claims arising during the period in which they are operating the ship in person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bareboat charterer is typically tasked with maintaining the ship’s condition during the charter period. However, it is important to note that, unless otherwise specified in the charter agreement, the bareboat charterer is not responsible for reasonable wear and tear on the vessel. To ensure that a fair assessment is made at the end of the charter period, most bareboat charters involve separate or joint surveyors who thoroughly inspect the ship and produce a detailed condition report. This report serves as a benchmark against which reasonable wear and tear can be measured.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is worth noting that damage or loss to the ship can occur regardless of the bareboat charterer’s fault. Therefore, it is common practice for the charter agreement to require the bareboat charterer to maintain hull and machinery insurance, with loss payable clauses directing payments to the shipowner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While a bareboat charter agreement may allocate responsibility for deductibles, it is more often the case that the bareboat charterer is responsible for these costs. Additionally, it is important to bear in mind that the shipowner is liable for any harm caused to third parties as a result of the ship’s operation, particularly in the case of time or voyage charters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bareboat Charter Party Form&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;bareboat-charter-party-form&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#bareboat-charter-party-form&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;We kindly suggest that you visit the web page of BIMCO (Baltic and International Maritime Council) to obtain the original Bareboat Charter Party Forms and documents. BARECON 2017 &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.bimco.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;www.bimco.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Voyage Charter Vs Time Charter&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;voyage-charter-vs-time-charter&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#voyage-charter-vs-time-charter&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;When a ship is chartered on a time or voyage basis, it remains under the operational and legal control of the shipowner, who is responsible for the crew, maintenance, and operation of the vessel. Consequently, any harm caused by the ship may be attributed to the shipowner, as well as to the ship itself. It is customary for shipowners to ensure that they have adequate insurance coverage against potential risks that may be incurred during operations under time and voyage charters. To ensure that the insurance package covers charter risks, express provisions are often included in time and voyage charters, specifying the permitted trades, cargoes, and ports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, voyage charters and time charters may include provisions in which the charterer agrees to warrant the safety of ports and indemnify the shipowner against the risks of any breaches of the permitted trade clauses. When a ship is chartered out as a bareboat charter, the shipowner must be concerned about liability. In addition to the contractual rights the shipowner has under the bareboat charter, the ship itself remains potentially liable, as if it were a person, in the event of an accident or other legally cognizable harm. This is known as in Rem Liability, which is distinguished from the separate liability that the shipowner or bareboat charterer may have in Personam Liability, potentially for the same actions and liabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shipowners typically warrant the seaworthiness of their vessels. Every charter agreement is deemed to include a generally recognized implied warranty of seaworthiness, even if the seaworthiness clause is not expressly stated in the charter party. Seaworthiness means that the ship is reasonably capable of safely transporting the cargo it has undertaken to transport within the specified trading areas, under the conditions that can reasonably be expected. The shipowner can expressly disclaim the warranty of seaworthiness in a charter, and such disclaimers are frequently found in ship lease finance transactions where the shipowner is a bank, financial institution, or leasing company. However, even with an express disclaimer, shipowners should be aware of potential liability for any latent defects that may arise prior to the commencement of a charter that would render the ship unseaworthy. Generally, the voyage charterer or time charterer is not liable for the seaworthiness of the vessel or the negligence of the ship’s crew.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In cases of time or voyage charter, the shipowner or bareboat charterer typically retains control of the vessel, with the charterer merely providing commercial direction. The ship will operate within the parameters of the charter, loading and discharging cargo as required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Traditionally, voyage or time charterers do not have authority over crew members and thus cannot be held accountable for their actions. However, if the charterer assumes responsibility for cargo-related operations such as loading, stowage, or discharging, then the shipowner may be held liable if any damage or loss occurs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For long-term bareboat charters, particularly those with finance arrangements, the bareboat charterer must ensure compliance with ongoing regulatory changes at their own expense. Short-term charters usually see the shipowner retain responsibility for complying with all relevant flag-state and international regulations. For example, changes to international air pollution regulations may necessitate the use of low sulfur fuels in certain coastal waters, or the replacement of older boiler systems. The shipowner typically bears these costs for vessels under time or voyage charter, whereas those under bareboat charter may be borne by either party depending on the specific provisions of the agreement. This may require a review of the ship owner’s obligation to provide a compliant vessel versus the charterer’s obligation to maintain compliance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bunker costs, including fuel for the main engine and auxiliary engines, can be a significant expense and are an important consideration in charter agreements. Under a bareboat charter, the shipowner assumes no responsibility for bunker costs as all operating responsibilities are assigned to the bareboat charterer. In a time charter, the time charterer is generally responsible for bunker costs incurred. In voyage charters, responsibility for bunker costs may be allocated to either party, depending on their preferences. Charterers must also allocate responsibility for bunkers that do not meet quality standards. Substandard bunkers may damage engines, cause power loss, and result in salvage costs, delays, or even the loss of the vessel. Failure to comply with regulations, such as sulfur content requirements, can result in civil penalties or detention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Responsibility for the consequences of using improper bunkers typically follows responsibility for the bunker costs, although this is not always the case. Charterers may not have the technical expertise or personnel to properly screen and test bunker providers, and may rely on the ship’s engineers to do so, even if the time or voyage charterer is responsible for the bunker costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bill of Lading (B/L) in Ship Chartering&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;bill-of-lading-bl-in-ship-chartering&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#bill-of-lading-bl-in-ship-chartering&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bill of Lading serves a multitude of purposes; however, it primarily functions as the contract between the shipper of goods and the carrier who assumes responsibility for transporting said goods. In the case of a bareboat chartered ship, the carrier may not be the shipowner, but rather the bareboat charterer, time charterer, or voyage charterer. By extending the limitations of liability and other protective provisions to the shipowner, the Bill of Lading mitigates the risk of indemnification claims. Within the shipping industry, there are fundamental charter terms that are unique to the field. These terms carry specific meanings that have become entrenched and often possess intriguing histories, originating from significant maritime decisions or ship casualties. For instance, charter lease payments, also known as “charter hire,” may be payable regardless of whether the ship completes the charter or not. Such provisions, where the charterer has no routine right of set-off or reduction in the amount payable to the shipowner, are often referred to as being payable on a “hell or high water” basis, as in charter hire shall be payable, come “hell or high water.” These charter payment provisions are typically found in bareboat charters and not in time charters or voyage charters. Time charter hire or voyage charter hire is typically subject to a right to set-off if the ship fails to perform under the charter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is FIOS in Ship Chartering?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;what-is-fios-in-ship-chartering&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#what-is-fios-in-ship-chartering&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The abbreviation FIO stands for Free In, Out, and FIOS stands for Free In, Out, and Stowage. The terms FIO and FIOS relate to the allocation of responsibility between the shipowner or bareboat charterer and the time charterer or voyage charterer regarding the loading and discharging of the ship. Under FIOS terms, the charterer takes responsibility for ensuring that the ship will be loaded, the cargo stowed, and the ship discharged, free to the shipowner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FIOS in ship chartering stands for &lt;strong&gt;“Free In and Out and Stowed.”&lt;/strong&gt; It is a term used in the shipping and chartering industry to describe the conditions under which cargo is loaded and discharged from a vessel. FIOS is typically agreed upon by both the shipowner and the charterer during negotiations and is included in the charter party agreement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under FIOS terms, the charterer is responsible for the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Free In:&lt;/strong&gt; The charterer bears the cost and responsibility for loading the cargo onto the vessel at the port of loading. This includes any stevedoring, labor, and equipment costs associated with getting the cargo on board.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Free Out:&lt;/strong&gt; The charterer is also responsible for the cost and responsibility of unloading the cargo from the vessel at the port of discharge. Similar to the loading process, this includes any costs related to stevedoring, labor, and equipment required for unloading.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stowed:&lt;/strong&gt; The charterer is responsible for the proper stowage of the cargo within the vessel. This means ensuring that the cargo is safely and securely placed in the ship’s holds to prevent any damage during transit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By agreeing to FIOS terms, the charterer takes on more responsibility for cargo handling, which may allow for more control over the loading and unloading process. However, it also means the charterer is responsible for any additional costs and potential risks associated with cargo handling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is FIO in Ship Chartering?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;what-is-fio-in-ship-chartering&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#what-is-fio-in-ship-chartering&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;FIO in ship chartering stands for &lt;strong&gt;“Free In and Out.”&lt;/strong&gt; It is a term used in the shipping and chartering industry to describe the conditions under which cargo is loaded and discharged from a vessel. FIO is typically agreed upon by both the shipowner and the charterer during negotiations and is included in the charter party agreement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under FIO terms, the charterer is responsible for the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Free In:&lt;/strong&gt; The charterer bears the cost and responsibility for loading the cargo onto the vessel at the port of loading. This includes any stevedoring, labor, and equipment costs associated with getting the cargo on board.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Free Out:&lt;/strong&gt; The charterer is also responsible for the cost and responsibility of unloading the cargo from the vessel at the port of discharge. Similar to the loading process, this includes any costs related to stevedoring, labor, and equipment required for unloading.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike the FIOS term, which includes “Stowed,” the FIO term does not cover the responsibility for the proper stowage of the cargo within the vessel. Under FIO terms, the shipowner is typically responsible for ensuring that the cargo is safely and securely placed in the ship’s holds to prevent any damage during transit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By agreeing to FIO terms, the charterer takes on the responsibility for cargo handling during loading and unloading but not for cargo stowage. This arrangement allows the charterer more control over the loading and unloading process while still relying on the shipowner’s expertise for proper stowage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Demurrage, Dispatch, and Lay Days in Ship Chartering&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;demurrage-dispatch-and-lay-days-in-ship-chartering&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#demurrage-dispatch-and-lay-days-in-ship-chartering&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Demurrage, Dispatch, and Lay Days are nautical terms commonly employed in the context of a voyage charter. A voyage charter is an agreement between the shipowner and the charterer for the transportation of cargo from one point to another, with the charter price being calculated based on the shipowner’s estimation of the time required for the voyage. However, the loading and unloading time of the cargo by the charterer is subject to a high degree of unpredictability, which is where the concept of Lay Days comes into play. Lay Days refer to the number of days allowed for the loading and discharging of cargo, and are employed to manage the uncertainty surrounding this activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The term Demurrage refers to the compensation payable by the voyage charterer to the shipowner in the event that the loading or unloading of cargo exceeds the agreed-upon Lay Days. Conversely, Dispatch refers to the compensation payable by the shipowner to the charterer if the loading or unloading of cargo is completed in less time than the allowed Lay Days. It is noteworthy that traditionally, Dispatch is priced at a rate that is 50% of the Demurrage rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These concepts have been developed over time to ensure the efficient utilization of ships and to allocate the risks associated with delays to the party that is best placed to influence the timing of the loading and unloading activities. In a voyage charter, the charterer is responsible for the purchase, utilization, and sale of the cargo, and is, therefore, in the best position to arrange for an efficient loading and unloading of the ship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dead Freight is another term that is commonly associated with voyage charters. In many voyage charters, the charter hire is based on the amount of cargo to be transported. If the charterer fails to load the expected amount of cargo, the shipowner is still obligated to undertake the voyage but will receive less revenue than anticipated. To manage this risk, a voyage charter will often specify a minimum amount of cargo to be transported, and if the charterer fails to load this amount, they will be liable to pay an amount known as Dead Freight, which is calculated based on the shortfall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In tanker chartering, the concept of vetting is primarily associated with oil companies that charter ships to transport their products. Given the high value of the cargo, the potential for significant losses due to ship breakdowns or port state detentions, and the risk of legal and reputational damage resulting from oil spills or other accidents, many charterers insist on the right to conduct their own ship condition inspections before or during chartering. These inspections, known as vetting inspections, are often comprehensive and evaluate the ship’s certificates, physical condition, and crew qualifications and experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Basic Terms in Ship Chartering&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;basic-terms-in-ship-chartering&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#basic-terms-in-ship-chartering&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the context of voyage charters, several key terms and concepts are commonly used to manage uncertainties and risks related to cargo loading and discharging, as well as ship conditions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lay Days:&lt;/strong&gt; The shipowner allows a certain number of days for loading and discharging cargo under a voyage charter. These days are referred to as lay days, and they help manage the unpredictability of loading and discharging times.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Demurrage:&lt;/strong&gt; If the charterer takes longer to load or discharge cargo than the agreed-upon lay days, they must pay the shipowner a fee called demurrage. This concept promotes efficient ship utilization and allocates the risk of delays to the party in the best position to manage loading and discharging times – the charterer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dispatch:&lt;/strong&gt; Conversely, if the charterer completes loading or discharging faster than the allowed lay days, the shipowner pays the charterer a fee called dispatch, typically priced at 50% of the demurrage rate. This encourages the charterer to be efficient and rewards them for saving time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dead Freight:&lt;/strong&gt; In voyage charters, the charter hire is often based on the amount of cargo carried. If the charterer loads less cargo than the shipowner expected, the charterer must pay the shipowner an amount called dead freight, based on the cargo shortfall. This protects the shipowner against revenue loss due to carrying less cargo than anticipated.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vetting:&lt;/strong&gt; In tanker chartering, vetting is a critical concept, particularly for oil companies chartering ships for their products. Due to the high value of cargo, potential delays, legal liabilities, and reputational risks from incidents like oil spills, charterers often insist on conducting their own ship condition inspections before chartering or continuing charters. These inspections, called vetting inspections, can be extensive, examining ship certificates, documents, physical condition, and crew qualifications and experience.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These terms and concepts are crucial in voyage chartering to ensure both parties have a clear understanding of their roles and responsibilities while minimizing risks and promoting efficiency:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;6&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Notice of Readiness (NOR):&lt;/strong&gt; The shipowner or master of the vessel issues a Notice of Readiness to inform the charterer that the vessel has arrived at the loading or discharging port and is ready to commence cargo operations. This notice marks the beginning of laytime, the period during which the charterer has to load or discharge the cargo within the agreed lay days.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Laytime:&lt;/strong&gt; Laytime refers to the time allowed by the shipowner for the charterer to load and discharge cargo without incurring additional costs. Laytime is usually stated in the charter party agreement and starts when the Notice of Readiness has been tendered. The calculation of laytime can be complex and may involve various exceptions and conditions such as weather-related interruptions and holidays.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Time Bar:&lt;/strong&gt; A time bar is a contractual provision that sets a deadline for a claim to be made by one party against the other. In voyage charters, time bars can apply to claims related to demurrage, dispatch, and other performance-related issues. If a claim is not made within the time bar period, the party’s right to claim may be forfeited.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Charter Party Agreement:&lt;/strong&gt; The charter party agreement is a legal contract between the shipowner and the charterer, outlining the terms and conditions of the voyage charter. This agreement contains various provisions, including the agreed freight rate, lay days, demurrage and dispatch rates, vetting requirements, and other specific terms related to the carriage of goods.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Freight:&lt;/strong&gt; Freight is the payment made by the charterer to the shipowner for the transportation of goods under a voyage charter. The freight rate is typically agreed upon in the charter party agreement and can be based on factors such as the type and volume of cargo, distance between ports, and prevailing market rates.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By understanding and utilizing these terms and concepts, both shipowners and charterers can better manage the risks and uncertainties inherent in the shipping and chartering industry, leading to a more efficient and secure transportation of goods across the globe.&lt;/p&gt;

These clauses typically arise in situations where the charterer may have already sold the cargo, even prior to the delivery of the ship.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;a href=&#34;#both-to-blame-collision-clauses-in-ship-chartering&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The purpose of Both to Blame Collision Clauses is to safeguard the limitation of liability clauses that are commonly present in charters and bills of lading. These clauses aim to prevent a loophole that could arise due to the maritime law’s allocation of collision damages. According to maritime law, a court will apportion damages between the parties at fault based on their comparative fault. However, both parties will be held jointly and severally liable to the victims of their fault. This means that the injured party can sue either of the parties at fault for the full amount of the damage, and the paying party can seek contribution from the other party at fault.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Typically, a ship owner’s liability for cargo damage is restricted to a specific amount, such as the $500 per package limitation under the United States Carriage of Goods at Sea Act (COGSA). Therefore, when a collision occurs due to the fault of both the cargo-carrying ship and another ship, the cargo owner’s right to damages from the cargo-carrying ship may be restricted. However, the cargo owner’s right to damages from the other ship at fault will not be limited. As a result, the cargo owner can sue the other ship for the full amount of its damages, under the maritime law of joint and several liability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other ship will then seek contribution from the cargo-carrying ship based on the latter’s degree of fault, so that the other ship does not bear an unfair proportion of the damages. In this way, cargo owners can avoid, and cargo-carrying ships can be denied, the contractual or statutory limitation of liability. The Both to Blame clause eliminates this issue by outlining an indemnification agreement, under which the cargo owner agrees to indemnify the cargo-carrying ship owner against any liability for damages paid to another ship in excess of the limitation amount.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;General Average (GA) in Ship Chartering&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;general-average-gain-ship-chartering&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#general-average-gain-ship-chartering&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;General Average (GA) is a customary legal principle recognized worldwide, which apportions losses suffered by one party for the collective benefit of all parties involved in a voyage. It originates from the shipmaster’s ancient right to sacrifice certain cargo or property or incur reasonable expenses to rescue the ship and its remaining cargo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance, let us consider a scenario where a ship, carrying a load of cargo, encounters unforeseen weather conditions that lead to damage. As a result, the ship requires a salvage tug to tow it to port, incurring additional costs. Alternatively, it may become necessary for the shipmaster to jettison some cargo to save the rest of the cargo and the vessel. Maritime law has traditionally regarded such expenses or losses as eligible for distribution among all beneficiaries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of the voyage, an average adjuster is designated to compute the costs of the salvage claim or the value of the lost cargo, as well as the value of the saved ship and cargo. Subsequently, the adjuster usually allocates the loss against the shipowner and the cargo owners based on the proportionate interests in the voyage. The charters often contain clauses that specify the regulations for determining the procedure for general average. The most widely acknowledged provisions entail the application of the York Antwerp Rule 1974.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We kindly suggest that you visit the web page of HandyBulk and search to learn more about the General Average (GA) &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.handybulk.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;www.handybulk.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New Jason Clause in Ship Chartering&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;new-jason-clause-in-ship-chartering&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#new-jason-clause-in-ship-chartering&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The New Jason Clause pertains to the concept of general average. According to the principles of general maritime law, cargo proprietors are typically exempt from contributing to general average if the loss incurred is a result of the shipowner’s negligence. However, shipowners often seek to overturn this rule by enforcing the New Jason Clause, which mandates that cargo owners are obligated to contribute to general average regardless of whether the loss was caused by the shipowner’s negligence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Handysize Bulk Carrier Chartering&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;handysize-bulk-carrier-chartering&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#handysize-bulk-carrier-chartering&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Handysize bulk carriers are versatile vessels that play a crucial role in the global shipping industry. Chartering these carriers involves a complex process of negotiation, communication, and coordination between various stakeholders, including ship owners, charterers, brokers, and agents. In this guide, we will provide an overview of the handysize bulk carrier chartering process, along with key considerations to keep in mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Market Research and Vessel Selection:&lt;/strong&gt; Begin by conducting thorough market research to understand the current supply and demand dynamics for handysize bulk carriers. This information will help you to identify suitable vessels that meet your cargo transportation requirements. Pay close attention to factors like vessel size, age, fuel efficiency, and the availability of loading and discharging equipment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chartering Options:&lt;/strong&gt; There are several types of chartering options available for handysize bulk carriers:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Voyage Charter:&lt;/strong&gt; The ship owner is responsible for providing a seaworthy vessel, and the charterer pays a freight rate based on the cargo quantity and the distance between the loading and discharging ports.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Time Charter:&lt;/strong&gt; The charterer rents the vessel for a specified period, paying a daily hire rate. The charterer is responsible for covering the vessel’s operating expenses, including fuel, port charges, and canal fees.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bareboat Charter:&lt;/strong&gt; The charterer rents the vessel without any crew, provisions, or insurance. The charterer is responsible for all operational expenses and management of the vessel.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;3&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Negotiating the Charter Party:&lt;/strong&gt; Once you have identified a suitable vessel and chartering option, negotiations will begin between the ship owner and charterer, typically through a broker. Key terms to be negotiated include the freight or hire rate, laytime (the time allowed for loading and discharging cargo), demurrage (penalty for exceeding laytime), and any additional clauses specific to the cargo or route.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fixing the Vessel:&lt;/strong&gt; Once the terms are agreed upon, the charter party is signed by both parties, and the vessel is considered “fixed.” The charterer will need to provide a Letter of Indemnity (LOI) to guarantee the fulfillment of contractual obligations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pre-fixture Operations:&lt;/strong&gt; Before the vessel’s arrival at the loading port, the charterer must coordinate with the ship owner, agents, and port authorities to ensure smooth operations. This includes preparing cargo documentation, arranging for surveys and inspections, and coordinating the vessel’s berthing and loading schedule.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Voyage Execution:&lt;/strong&gt; During the voyage, the charterer must monitor the vessel’s performance, fuel consumption, and adherence to the agreed-upon route. Regular communication with the vessel’s master and agents at the loading and discharging ports is essential to ensure timely operations and minimize delays.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Post-fixture Operations:&lt;/strong&gt; After the cargo has been discharged, the charterer must settle any outstanding financial matters, such as demurrage claims, and provide feedback on the vessel’s performance to the ship owner or broker.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Handysize Bulk Carrier Chartering requires a deep understanding of market dynamics, careful selection of vessels and chartering options, and strong negotiation skills. By following these guidelines and maintaining open lines of communication throughout the process, charterers can successfully transport their cargo while minimizing risks and maximizing efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is Handysize Bulk Carrier?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;what-is-handysize-bulk-carrier&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#what-is-handysize-bulk-carrier&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Handysize Bulk Carrier is a type of dry cargo ship that is designed to transport unpackaged bulk commodities such as coal, grain, iron ore, and other raw materials. The term “Handysize” refers to the vessel’s size, which is smaller and more versatile compared to larger bulk carriers such as Panamax, Capesize, and Supramax.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Handysize Bulk Carriers generally have a deadweight tonnage (DWT) ranging from 15,000 to 35,000 tons, making them well-suited for ports with size restrictions or limited infrastructure. These vessels are also characterized by their flexibility in terms of cargo type and trade routes, allowing them to operate in various markets and cater to diverse cargo requirements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main features of a Handysize Bulk Carrier include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Multiple cargo holds:&lt;/strong&gt; Handysize Bulk Carriers typically have five to seven cargo holds, providing the flexibility to carry different types of cargo simultaneously or in separate compartments.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cargo handling equipment:&lt;/strong&gt; Handysize Bulk Carriers are often equipped with their own onboard cranes or derricks for loading and unloading, which enables them to operate in ports without dedicated cargo handling infrastructure.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Draft and beam:&lt;/strong&gt; Handysize Bulk Carriers have a relatively shallow draft and smaller beam compared to larger bulk carriers, allowing them to access a wider range of ports and waterways.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fuel efficiency:&lt;/strong&gt; Due to their smaller size, Handysize Bulk Carriers generally have lower fuel consumption compared to larger vessels, making them more cost-effective for certain routes and cargo types.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Handysize Bulk Carriers play a significant role in the global shipping industry, particularly in short-sea shipping and regional trade, where their versatility and adaptability make them an attractive option for transporting a wide range of bulk commodities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to their versatility, Handysize Bulk Carriers offer several other advantages in the shipping industry:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Economies of scale:&lt;/strong&gt; While Handysize Bulk Carriers may not have the same economies of scale as larger vessels, they can still transport substantial quantities of cargo in a cost-effective manner. This is particularly true for trade routes with lower cargo volumes, where larger vessels would not be fully utilized.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Niche markets:&lt;/strong&gt; Handysize Bulk Carriers are well-suited for niche markets and specialized trades, such as the transportation of agricultural products, minor bulk cargoes, and project cargo. Their ability to access smaller ports and handle a diverse range of cargo types enables them to service these markets effectively.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Flexibility in changing market conditions:&lt;/strong&gt; The adaptability of Handysize Bulk Carriers allows them to respond to fluctuations in cargo demand and market conditions more easily than larger vessels. This flexibility enables shipowners and charterers to take advantage of emerging trade opportunities and to mitigate risks associated with market volatility.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lower port costs:&lt;/strong&gt; Due to their smaller size, Handysize Bulk Carriers often incur lower port fees and charges compared to larger vessels. This can lead to significant cost savings for both shipowners and charterers, particularly on routes with multiple port calls.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reduced environmental impact:&lt;/strong&gt; Handysize Bulk Carriers generally have lower fuel consumption and greenhouse gas emissions compared to larger vessels. This makes them a more environmentally friendly option for transporting bulk commodities, which can be an important consideration for shipowners, charterers, and regulators.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite these advantages, Handysize Bulk Carriers also face certain challenges, such as competition from larger vessels and the need to maintain a diverse cargo base to ensure profitability. As a result, it is essential for shipowners, operators, and charterers to stay informed about market trends, regulatory changes, and emerging trade opportunities in order to optimize the performance of their Handysize Bulk Carriers and to maximize their return on investment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Handysize Bulk Carriers play a vital role in the global shipping industry, providing a flexible and adaptable solution for transporting a wide range of bulk commodities. By leveraging their unique advantages and addressing potential challenges, Handysize Bulk Carriers will continue to be a key component of the global maritime trade landscape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is Handymax Bulk Carrier?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;what-is-handymax-bulk-carrier&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#what-is-handymax-bulk-carrier&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Handymax bulk carrier is a type of dry bulk cargo ship designed to transport large quantities of dry, unpackaged commodities such as coal, grains, ores, and other similar goods. The term “Handymax” refers to a specific size category of bulk carriers, typically with a carrying capacity ranging from 35,000 to 50,000 deadweight tonnage (DWT).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Handymax bulk carriers are smaller than Supramax carriers (which have a capacity of around 50,000 to 60,000 DWT) and considerably smaller than Panamax carriers (which can carry up to 80,000 DWT). The Handymax category offers a balance between carrying capacity and operational flexibility, making them suitable for a variety of trade routes and cargo types.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like Supramax carriers, Handymax vessels are often equipped with on-board cranes that enable them to self-load and unload cargo. This feature allows them to operate at ports with limited or no cargo handling facilities, enhancing their versatility and making them a popular choice for trade routes that include smaller ports or less developed regions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is Supramax Bulk Carrier?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;what-is-supramax-bulk-carrier&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#what-is-supramax-bulk-carrier&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Supramax bulk carrier is a type of dry bulk cargo ship designed to transport large quantities of dry, unpackaged commodities, such as coal, grains, ores, and other similar goods. The term “Supramax” refers to a specific size category of bulk carriers, typically ranging between 50,000 and 60,000 deadweight tonnage (DWT).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Supramax bulk carriers are larger than Handymax carriers (which have a capacity of around 35,000 to 50,000 DWT) but smaller than Panamax carriers (which can carry up to 80,000 DWT). The Supramax category was created to fill the gap between Handymax and Panamax sizes, offering an optimal balance of carrying capacity, flexibility, and cost efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These vessels are equipped with on-board cranes, which give them the ability to self-load and unload cargo, allowing them to operate at ports with limited or no cargo handling facilities. This versatility makes Supramax bulk carriers well-suited for a wide range of trade routes and cargo types.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is Ultramax Bulk Carrier?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;what-is-ultramax-bulk-carrier&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#what-is-ultramax-bulk-carrier&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;An Ultramax bulk carrier is a type of dry bulk cargo ship designed to transport large quantities of dry, unpackaged commodities such as coal, grains, ores, and other similar goods. The term “Ultramax” refers to a specific size category of bulk carriers that generally fall within the Supramax range, with a carrying capacity of around 60,000 to 65,000 deadweight tonnage (DWT).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultramax bulk carriers are a relatively new classification, offering improved fuel efficiency and larger cargo capacities compared to traditional Supramax and Handymax vessels. They are larger than Handymax carriers (which have a capacity of around 35,000 to 50,000 DWT) and slightly larger than Supramax carriers (which have a capacity of around 50,000 to 60,000 DWT), but smaller than Panamax carriers (which can carry up to 80,000 DWT).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like Supramax and Handymax carriers, Ultramax vessels are typically equipped with on-board cranes that enable them to self-load and unload cargo. This feature allows them to operate at ports with limited or no cargo handling facilities, enhancing their versatility and making them a popular choice for trade routes that include smaller ports or less developed regions. The enhanced cargo capacity and fuel efficiency of Ultramax carriers make them an attractive option for shippers seeking to optimize their supply chains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is Panamax Bulk Carrier?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;what-is-panamax-bulk-carrier&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#what-is-panamax-bulk-carrier&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Panamax bulk carrier is a type of dry bulk cargo ship designed to transport large quantities of dry, unpackaged commodities such as coal, grains, ores, and other similar goods. The term “Panamax” refers to a specific size category of bulk carriers, with a carrying capacity of up to 80,000 deadweight tonnage (DWT). The name “Panamax” is derived from the fact that these vessels are specifically designed to meet the size limitations of the original Panama Canal, which connects the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Panamax bulk carriers are larger than Handymax (which have a capacity of around 35,000 to 50,000 DWT), Supramax (which have a capacity of around 50,000 to 60,000 DWT), and Ultramax (which have a capacity of around 60,000 to 65,000 DWT) carriers. Due to their size, they offer economies of scale, making them more cost-effective for transporting large quantities of cargo over long distances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike Supramax, Handymax, and Ultramax carriers, Panamax vessels are not typically equipped with on-board cranes, as they rely on port facilities for loading and unloading cargo. This means that Panamax carriers are more dependent on the infrastructure available at the ports they visit, and they are less versatile when it comes to accessing smaller ports or those with limited cargo handling facilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the expansion of the Panama Canal in 2016, a new class of larger vessels called “New Panamax” or “Neopanamax” was introduced, which can carry up to 120,000 DWT. These vessels are too large for the original Panama Canal locks but can transit through the expanded canal, further enhancing economies of scale for bulk cargo transportation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is Neopanamax Bulk Carrier?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;what-is-neopanamax-bulk-carrier&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#what-is-neopanamax-bulk-carrier&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Neopanamax bulk carrier is a type of cargo ship specifically designed to fit within the size constraints of the expanded Panama Canal, also known as the Neopanamax or New Panamax. The Panama Canal, a crucial global shipping route, connects the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, allowing ships to avoid the longer and more treacherous route around the southern tip of South America. In 2016, the canal underwent a significant expansion to accommodate larger ships, and the new maximum size of ships that could pass through was defined as Neopanamax.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neopanamax bulk carriers are used to transport large quantities of dry, unpackaged cargo, such as coal, iron ore, grain, or other bulk commodities. These vessels are built to optimize the use of the expanded canal dimensions, which are 366 meters (1,200 feet) in length, 49 meters (160.7 feet) in width, and 15.2 meters (49.9 feet) in draft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By adhering to these dimensions, Neopanamax bulk carriers can benefit from the shorter transit time and reduced costs associated with using the Panama Canal compared to alternative routes. This allows them to be more competitive in the global shipping market, contributing to the efficiency of the international trade system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is Kamsarmax Bulk Carrier?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;what-is-kamsarmax-bulk-carrier&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#what-is-kamsarmax-bulk-carrier&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Kamsarmax bulk carrier is a type of dry bulk cargo vessel specifically designed to meet the maximum size restrictions for the berthing and loading facilities at the Port of Kamsar in the Republic of Guinea. Kamsarmaxes are a larger variant of the popular Panamax vessels, which were initially built to fit the size constraints of the original Panama Canal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The primary purpose of Kamsarmax bulk carriers is to transport dry, unpackaged cargo such as coal, iron ore, grain, and other bulk commodities. The size specifications for a Kamsarmax vessel are typically as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Length overall (LOA): up to 229 meters (751 feet)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Beam (width): up to 32.3 meters (106 feet)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Draft: up to 14.5 meters (47.5 feet)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Kamsarmax design allows these vessels to carry more cargo compared to standard Panamax ships, making them more efficient and economical for certain shipping routes. Their larger size enables them to take advantage of economies of scale, reducing transportation costs per unit of cargo. Kamsarmax vessels are widely used in the global shipping industry, particularly for routes that do not require transiting the Panama Canal or where the larger Neopanamax vessels are not necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is Baby Capesize Bulk Carrier?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;what-is-baby-capesize-bulk-carrier&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#what-is-baby-capesize-bulk-carrier&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Baby Capesize bulk carrier, also known as a Mini Capesize or Small Capesize, is a type of dry bulk cargo vessel that is smaller than the traditional Capesize carriers but larger than Panamax and Kamsarmax vessels. Baby Capesizes are designed to carry unpackaged bulk commodities such as iron ore, coal, grain, or other raw materials. The primary advantage of a Baby Capesize is its ability to navigate through certain ports and waterways that are inaccessible to standard Capesize vessels due to size restrictions, while still offering a larger cargo capacity compared to Panamax or Kamsarmax ships.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dimensions of a Baby Capesize bulk carrier typically fall within the following range:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Length overall (LOA): 225 to 250 meters (738 to 820 feet)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Beam (width): 32 to 43 meters (105 to 141 feet)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Draft: 14.5 to 18 meters (47.5 to 59 feet)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These vessels usually have a cargo capacity of around 80,000 to 120,000 deadweight tons (DWT). Their smaller size allows them to access more ports and loading facilities, offering greater flexibility in terms of trade routes and cargo handling compared to standard Capesize vessels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Baby Capesize bulk carriers are an important part of the global shipping industry as they bridge the gap between Panamax or Kamsarmax vessels and traditional Capesize ships. They contribute to the efficiency and versatility of the international trade system by providing more options for transporting bulk commodities across various routes and port facilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is Capesize Bulk Carrier?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;what-is-capesize-bulk-carrier&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#what-is-capesize-bulk-carrier&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Capesize bulk carrier is a large dry bulk cargo ship designed to transport unpackaged bulk commodities such as iron ore, coal, grain, or other raw materials. The term “Capesize” originates from the fact that these vessels are too large to transit the Panama Canal and, historically, they needed to navigate around the Cape of Good Hope in South Africa or Cape Horn in South America to travel between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Capesize bulk carriers have the following typical dimensions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Length overall (LOA): 270 to 300 meters (885 to 984 feet)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Beam (width): 43 to 45 meters (141 to 148 feet)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Draft: 18 meters (59 feet) or more&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These vessels can carry cargo capacities ranging from approximately 100,000 to 200,000 deadweight tons (DWT), with some newer, larger Capesize vessels exceeding 300,000 DWT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to their size, Capesize bulk carriers are not suited for all ports, and they usually require specialized deepwater terminals and large cargo handling facilities to load and unload their cargo.

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Global economic growth:&lt;/strong&gt; Stronger economic growth generally translates to higher demand for raw materials and commodities, leading to increased demand for dry bulk shipping and upward pressure on freight rates.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fleet supply:&lt;/strong&gt; The supply of dry bulk carriers is impacted by the rate of new vessel deliveries and scrapping of older vessels. An oversupplied market with a high number of new vessel deliveries can lead to lower freight rates, whereas a tighter supply may push rates higher.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Commodity demand:&lt;/strong&gt; Demand for key dry bulk commodities, such as iron ore, coal, and grain, plays a significant role in determining freight rates. Factors such as industrial production, urbanization, and global trade policies can impact the demand for these commodities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Seasonal factors:&lt;/strong&gt; Dry bulk freight rates often exhibit seasonal patterns, with higher demand during certain times of the year. For example, grain exports tend to peak during harvest seasons, while coal demand may increase during the winter months in the Northern Hemisphere.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Geopolitical events:&lt;/strong&gt; Political developments, trade disputes, and regulatory changes can have a significant impact on the dry bulk shipping market and freight rates.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How Dry Bulk Freight is calculated?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;how-dry-bulk-freight-is-calculated&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#how-dry-bulk-freight-is-calculated&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dry bulk freight is typically calculated based on several factors, which may include the type and size of the vessel, the cargo volume or weight, the distance between the origin and destination ports, and prevailing market conditions. Here’s an overview of the main components involved in calculating dry bulk freight rates:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ship Type and Size:&lt;/strong&gt; The size and type of the bulk carrier play a significant role in determining the freight rate. Larger vessels, like Capesize, typically command higher freight rates due to their greater cargo capacity, while smaller vessels, like Handysize, may have lower rates. The age and condition of the vessel can also impact the rate, with newer and more efficient ships potentially commanding a premium.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dry Bulk Cargo Volume or Weight:&lt;/strong&gt; The amount of cargo being shipped, usually measured in metric tons, is a crucial factor in determining the freight rate. Some contracts may be based on a fixed rate per ton, while others may use a sliding scale, with the rate per ton decreasing as the total cargo volume increases.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Distance and Route:&lt;/strong&gt; The distance between the origin and destination ports directly impacts the cost of shipping, with longer distances generally resulting in higher freight rates. The specific route taken may also influence the rate, as factors like congestion, port fees, and canal transit fees can affect the overall shipping cost.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dry Bulk Shipping Market Conditions:&lt;/strong&gt; Prevailing market conditions, such as supply and demand for dry bulk carriers, can significantly impact freight rates. During periods of high demand or limited supply, rates may increase, while an oversupply of vessels or reduced demand can lead to lower rates.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Time Charter or Voyage Charter:&lt;/strong&gt; Dry bulk freight can be calculated based on either a time charter or voyage charter agreement. In a time charter, the rate is typically expressed as a daily rate (dollars per day) for the use of the vessel, while in a voyage charter, the rate is expressed as a lump sum or per-ton rate for the entire voyage. The choice between these two options can depend on factors like the length of the voyage, the flexibility required, and the charterer’s preferences.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Additional Costs:&lt;/strong&gt; When calculating dry bulk freight, it is essential to consider additional costs that may be incurred during the shipping process. These can include bunker fuel costs, port charges, canal transit fees, and other expenses related to the voyage. In some cases, these costs may be included in the freight rate, while in others, they may be billed separately.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By taking all of these factors into account, you can calculate the dry bulk freight rate for a specific shipment. Keep in mind that rates can be subject to negotiation and may fluctuate based on market conditions and other variables.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;h2&gt;The Earth&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;the-earth&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#the-earth&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earth is a terrestrial planet in the Solar System, the third planet from the Sun. It is the only astronomical object known to support life. Earth is a sphere with a slightly flattened diameter of about 12,742 kilometers (7,918 mi). Its mass is about 5.972 × 10^24 kilograms (1.317 × 10^25 lb). Earth&amp;rsquo;s atmosphere is composed of 78.09% nitrogen, 20.95% oxygen, 0.93% argon, 0.04% carbon dioxide, and small amounts of other gases. Earth&amp;rsquo;s hydrosphere covers about 71% of its surface and is essential for life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Earth&amp;rsquo;s interior is divided into three main layers:&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;earths-interior-is-divided-into-three-main-layers&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#earths-interior-is-divided-into-three-main-layers&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The crust is the outermost layer and is made up of solid rock. It is about 5 to 70 kilometers (3 to 43 mi) thick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mantle is the middle layer and is made up of molten rock. It is about 2,900 kilometers (1,800 mi) thick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The core is the innermost layer and is made up of solid iron and nickel. It is about 7,000 kilometers (4,300 mi) thick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Earth&amp;rsquo;s interior age&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;earths-interior-age&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#earths-interior-age&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The age of Earth&amp;rsquo;s interior is estimated to be about 4.54 billion years old. This is based on the age of meteorites, which are thought to have formed from the same material as the early Earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Scientists have used a variety of methods to estimate the age of Earth&amp;rsquo;s interior, including:&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;scientists-have-used-a-variety-of-methods-to-estimate-the-age-of-earths-interior-including&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Radiometric dating: This method uses the decay of radioactive isotopes to determine the age of rocks and minerals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paleomagnetism: This method studies the magnetic field of the Earth as it has changed over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Geochronology: This method studies the layering of rocks to determine their relative ages.
These methods have all given similar ages for Earth&amp;rsquo;s interior, suggesting that it formed about 4.54 billion years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earth is a dynamic planet with a complex interior. Scientists are still learning about the age and composition of Earth&amp;rsquo;s interior, but they have made significant progress in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;By influencing global temperatures and precipitation, the El Niño/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) significantly impacts Earth’s ecosystems and human societies. El Niño and La Niña are opposite extremes of the ENSO, which refers to cyclical environmental conditions that occur across the Equatorial Pacific Ocean. These changes are due to natural interactions between the ocean and atmosphere. Sea surface temperature, rainfall, air pressure, atmospheric and ocean circulation all influence each other.

&lt;h2&gt;What is El Niño? What is La Niña?&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;what-is-el-niño-what-is-la-niña&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#what-is-el-ni%c3%b1o-what-is-la-ni%c3%b1a&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;An El Niño condition occurs when surface water in the equatorial Pacific becomes warmer than average and east winds blow weaker than normal. The opposite condition is called La Niña. During this phase of ENSO, the water is cooler than normal and the east winds are stronger. El Niños typically occur every 3 to 5 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ENSO-Neutral or average conditions across the tropical Pacific Ocean. Climate.gov schematic by Emily Eng and inspired by NOAA PMEL.
The rise of El Niño and La Niña
How do El Niño and La Niña events form and increase in strength? The key is in the ocean-atmosphere coupling across the tropical Pacific Ocean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How ENSO impacts humans?&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;how-enso-impacts-humans&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#how-enso-impacts-humans&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;El Niño, La Niña, and the neutral condition all produce important consequences for people and ecosystems across the globe. The interactions between the ocean and atmosphere alters weather around the world and can result in severe storms or mild weather, drought or flooding. Beyond “just” influencing the weather, these changes can produce secondary results that influence food supplies and prices, forest fires, and create additional economic and political consequences. Famines and political strife can result from these environmental conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(top) The sea surface temperature (shaded contours), 10-meter wind (vectors), and (bottom) rainfall departures from average in June – August during an average Atlantic Niño. The gray dots in the bottom panel indicate that the rainfall departures are statistically significant (5% significance level), indicating a high degree of confidence that the rainfall departures are associated with Atlantic Niño. Climate.gov figure adapted from Vallès‐Casanova et al. (2020).
Do you know that El Niño has a little brother?
His name is Atlantic Niño, and he has an uncanny resemblance to his big brother: Like El Niño, Atlantic Niño is characterized by warmer-than-average sea surface temperatures in the eastern equatorial basin and weaker-than-average trade winds throughout the east-central equatorial Atlantic.
What are some of ENSO&amp;rsquo;s impacts?
Ecosystems and human communities can be positively or negatively affected. For example, in the Southern United States, during the fall through spring, El Niño usually causes increased rainfall and sometimes destructive flooding. La Niña, however, usually causes drier weather in the South, but the Northwest tends to be colder and wetter than average. Even though El Niño occurs in the Pacific Ocean, it often reduces the number of hurricanes that form in the Atlantic Ocean. Conversely, La Niña events tend to be related to an increase in the number of Atlantic hurricanes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Food production is impacted by ENSO. Changes in ocean temperatures and currents that happen during El Niño impact marine life. This can impact individuals who make a living fishing and consumers who depend on certain fish for food. Agriculture is of course very dependent on climate and weather, as a result ENSO’s influence on rainfall and temperature have important consequences for food production and availability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Can volcanic eruptions cause El Niño? Maybe, maybe not&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;can-volcanic-eruptions-cause-el-niño-maybe-maybe-not&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#can-volcanic-eruptions-cause-el-ni%c3%b1o-maybe-maybe-not&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Volcanic eruptions have had HUGE impacts on the global climate by cooling Earth. It’s only natural to wonder, if the planet is affected by volcanic eruptions, can ENSO be?
The origin of the name
The origin of the name “El Niño” dates to the 1800’s, when fishermen on the Pacific coast of South America would notice that a warm ocean current would appear every few years. Fish catches would drop drastically, negatively affecting the food supply and livelihood of the communities of coastal Peru. This warm water would arrive around Christmastime. Referring to the birth of Christ, they named the warm ocean waters, El Niño, which means “the boy” in Spanish. Fishing in this region is best during La Niña years when cold upwelling ocean water brings rich nutrientsoffsite link from the deep ocean, resulting in an increase in the number of fish caught.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Southern Oscillation is a coherent interannual fluctuation of atmospheric pressure over the tropical Indo-Pacific region&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is the atmospheric component of a single large-scale coupled interaction called the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Southern Oscillation describes changes in air pressure patterns in the Southern Pacific Ocean between Tahiti, in the middle of the southern Pacific Ocean, and Darwin, Australia, to the west 2. Normally, lower pressure over Darwin and higher pressure over Tahiti encourages air movement from east to west 2. The Southern Oscillation Index (SOI) tracks the atmospheric part of the ENSO pattern 3.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

Datums are important because they allow us to compare geospatial data from different sources and to create maps and charts that are accurate and consistent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Types of datums&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;types-of-datums&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#types-of-datums&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are two main types of datums: horizontal datums and vertical datums.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Horizontal datums&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;horizontal-datums&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#horizontal-datums&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;are used to measure distances on a flat surface, such as the Earth&amp;rsquo;s surface. Horizontal datums are typically based on a geodetic reference frame, which is a global network of survey markers. The most common geodetic reference frame is the World Geodetic System 1984 (WGS 84). WGS 84 is used by GPS receivers to determine their positions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vertical datums&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;vertical-datums&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#vertical-datums&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;are used to measure elevations. Vertical datums are typically based on a mean sea level datum. Mean sea level is the average height of the sea&amp;rsquo;s surface over a period of time, typically 19 years. The most common vertical datum in the United States is the North American Vertical Datum of 1988 (NAVD 88). NAVD 88 is used to measure elevations for a variety of purposes, including mapping, surveying, and construction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Establishment of datums&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;establishment-of-datums&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#establishment-of-datums&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Datums are established by government agencies, such as the National Geodetic Survey in the United States. These agencies use a variety of geodetic and surveying techniques to establish datums.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To establish a horizontal datum, geodetic surveyors measure the positions of survey markers using a variety of techniques, such as triangulation, trilateration, and GPS. Once the positions of the survey markers have been measured, the surveyors use this data to calculate the geodetic reference frame.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To establish a vertical datum, geodetic surveyors measure sea levels at a network of tide gauge stations. Once the sea levels have been measured, the surveyors use this data to calculate the mean sea level datum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Maintenance of datums&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;maintenance-of-datums&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#maintenance-of-datums&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once a datum has been established, it is important to maintain it. This means regularly resurveying the geodetic reference markers and measuring sea levels. It is also important to update datums as new geodetic and surveying technologies are developed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Applications of datums&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;applications-of-datums&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#applications-of-datums&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Datums are used in a wide variety of applications, including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mapping:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;mapping&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#mapping&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Datums are used to create maps and charts that are accurate and consistent. For example, datums are used to create nautical charts, which are used by mariners to navigate the seas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Surveying:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;surveying&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#surveying&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Datums are used by surveyors to measure distances and elevations. For example, datums are used to survey construction sites and to create boundary maps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GPS:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;gps&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#gps&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Datums are used by GPS receivers to determine their positions. For example, datums are used by hikers to find their way on trails and by drivers to navigate to their destinations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Other examples of datums&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;other-examples-of-datums&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#other-examples-of-datums&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to the horizontal and vertical datums mentioned above, there are a number of other datums that are used for specific purposes. For example, the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) datum is used to coordinate the different GNSS systems, such as GPS, GLONASS, and Galileo. The International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service (IERS) provides a variety of datums for use in different applications, such as geodesy, astronomy, and oceanography.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#conclusion&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Datums are essential for a wide variety of applications. They allow us to measure distances, elevations, and other geospatial data accurately and consistently. Datums are established and maintained by government agencies, and they are used by a variety of people and organizations for a variety of purposes.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;h2&gt;Exceptions to Laytime&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;exceptions-to-laytime&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#exceptions-to-laytime&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a voyage charterparty agreement, there are certain situations where laytime may be suspended or not counted. These exceptions to laytime are generally outlined in the charterparty terms and conditions. Some common exceptions to laytime include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Weather Conditions:&lt;/strong&gt; Laytime may be suspended or not counted during periods of bad weather, such as heavy rain, storms, or fog, which can disrupt or delay loading and discharging operations. This type of exception is often referred to as Weather Working Days (WWD).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Weekends and Holidays:&lt;/strong&gt; Laytime may be excluded on weekends, public holidays, or any other non-working days agreed upon in the charterparty. This exception is typically referred to as “Saturdays, Sundays, and Holidays Excepted” (SSHE) or “Saturdays, Sundays, Holidays Included” (SSHI), depending on whether laytime is counted or not during those days.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Force Majeure Events:&lt;/strong&gt; Laytime may be suspended during unforeseeable events or circumstances beyond the control of the parties involved, such as natural disasters, strikes, war, or other similar events. Force majeure clauses in the charterparty protect both parties from being held responsible for delays or failures in performance due to such events.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Breakdowns or Accidents:&lt;/strong&gt; Laytime may be suspended if the ship experiences a breakdown, accident, or any other operational issue that prevents the loading or discharging of cargo.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Customs or Regulatory Delays:&lt;/strong&gt; Laytime may be suspended or not counted during delays caused by customs inspections, port authority regulations, or other bureaucratic procedures.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Waiting for Berth:&lt;/strong&gt; Laytime may be suspended while the ship is waiting for a berth to become available at the port. This exception is typically referred to as “Waiting for Berth” or “Berth or No Berth” clauses.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shifting Between Berths:&lt;/strong&gt; Laytime may be suspended during the time spent by the ship shifting between berths, as long as the shifting is not due to the ship’s fault or inefficiency.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Specific Charterparty Clauses:&lt;/strong&gt; The charterparty agreement may include additional exceptions or suspensions to laytime based on the specific circumstances or requirements of the parties involved.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is essential for both the shipowner and the charterer to be aware of these exceptions to laytime, as they can significantly impact the calculation of &lt;strong&gt;Demurrage or Despatch payments in a voyage charterparty agreement&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;h2&gt;Definition&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;definition&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#definition&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The extraction of minerals from the seabed is a relatively new and developing industry. It involves the retrieval of mineral deposits from the ocean floor at depths of 200 metres /660 feet or more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are three main types of mineral deposits that are of interest for seabed mining: polymetallic nodules, seafloor massive sulfides (SMS), and cobalt-rich ferromanganese crusts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Polymetallic nodules&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;polymetallic-nodules&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#polymetallic-nodules&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;are potato-sized rocks that are found on the deep ocean floor. They contain a variety of metals, including nickel, copper, manganese, and cobalt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Seafloor massive&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;seafloor-massive&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#seafloor-massive&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;sulfides are formed by hydrothermal vents on the ocean floor. They contain a variety of metals, including copper, zinc, lead, gold, and silver.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Cobalt-rich ferromanganese crusts&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;cobalt-rich-ferromanganese-crusts&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#cobalt-rich-ferromanganese-crusts&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;are thin layers of metal-rich material that coat rocks on the ocean floor. They contain a variety of metals, including cobalt, nickel, and manganese.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Extraction Process&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;extraction-process&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#extraction-process&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The extraction of minerals from the seabed is a complex and challenging process. The ocean floor is a hostile environment, and the mineral deposits are often located in deep water. This makes it difficult and expensive to mine the minerals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a number of different methods that are being developed for extracting minerals from the seabed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One common method is to use a collector vehicle to collect the minerals from the ocean floor. The collector vehicle is then attached to a riser system that transports the minerals to a surface vessel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another method of extracting minerals from the seabed is to use a seafloor mining system. Seafloor mining systems are large machines that can be used to mine a variety of mineral deposits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The extraction of minerals from the seabed is a controversial topic. Some people argue that seabed mining is necessary to meet the growing demand for metals. Others argue that seabed mining is too risky and that it could damage the marine environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a number of environmental concerns associated with seabed mining.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One concern is that seabed mining could damage sensitive marine habitats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another concern is that seabed mining could release harmful chemicals and sediments into the water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Noise pollution : Mining operations could produce a lot of noise which could disturb marine animals and disrupt heir communication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Biodiversity loss of deep-sea species which are not well-studied and understood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is important to weigh the environmental risks and benefits of seabed mining before making a decision about whether or not to allow seabed mining to proceed.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;h2&gt;What is CCRF?&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;what-is-ccrf&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#what-is-ccrf&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The FAO Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries (CCRF) is a voluntary international instrument that sets out principles and standards for the conservation, management and development of living aquatic resources. It was adopted by the FAO Conference in 1995 and has since been endorsed by over 180 countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The CCRF is based on the following principles:&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;the-ccrf-is-based-on-the-following-principles&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;li&gt;In many countries, the CCRF has been used to develop national fisheries management plans.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The CCRF has also been used to develop regional fisheries management organizations (RFMOs), which are responsible for managing shared fish stocks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the aquaculture sector, the CCRF has been used to develop standards for sustainable aquaculture practices.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The CCRF is also being used to promote international cooperation on fisheries and aquaculture issues.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The CCRF is not a legally binding instrument, but it is a highly respected and influential document. It has played an important role in raising awareness of the need for responsible fisheries and aquaculture practices.&lt;/li&gt;

      <title>Financial elements of charter parties (freight per ton. or lump sum)</title>
      <link>https://www.anirbanmarine.in/docs/partc/em303/cshipmgmt/finelements/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://www.anirbanmarine.in/docs/partc/em303/cshipmgmt/finelements/</guid>
      <description>
        
        
        &lt;p&gt;The financial elements of charter parties can be complex and vary depending on the type of charter party and the specific terms agreed upon between the shipper and carrier. However, there are two main types of freight payments that are typically used in charter parties: freight per ton and lump sum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Freight per ton&lt;/strong&gt; is the most common type of freight payment used in charter parties, particularly for dry bulk and tanker shipments. In a freight per ton charter party, the shipper agrees to pay the carrier a certain amount of money for each ton of cargo that is transported. The freight rate is typically negotiated in advance and is based on a number of factors, such as the type of cargo, the distance to be traveled, and the current market conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Some examples of freight per ton charter parties include:&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;some-examples-of-freight-per-ton-charter-parties-include&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#some-examples-of-freight-per-ton-charter-parties-include&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A grain merchant chartering a bulk carrier to transport wheat from Brazil to China&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An oil company chartering a tanker to transport crude oil from the Middle East to Europe&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A steel mill chartering an ore carrier to transport iron ore from Australia to Japan&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lump sum&lt;/strong&gt; freight payments are typically used for charter parties involving container ships and passenger ships. In a lump sum charter party, the shipper agrees to pay the carrier a fixed amount of money for the entire charter period, regardless of the amount of cargo that is transported. Lump sum freight payments are often used for charter parties involving multiple ports of call or when the shipper needs to ensure that the ship will be available for their exclusive use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Some examples of lump sum charter parties include:&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;some-examples-of-lump-sum-charter-parties-include&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#some-examples-of-lump-sum-charter-parties-include&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A cruise line chartering a cruise ship for the entire summer season&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A shipping company chartering a container ship to transport goods between Europe and Asia&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A military organization chartering a passenger ship to transport troops&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;In addition to freight payments, charter parties may also include other financial elements, such as:&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;in-addition-to-freight-payments-charter-parties-may-also-include-other-financial-elements-such-as&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#in-addition-to-freight-payments-charter-parties-may-also-include-other-financial-elements-such-as&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Loading and discharging costs:&lt;/strong&gt; These costs are typically borne by the charterer, but they may be included in the freight rate or negotiated separately.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Port costs:&lt;/strong&gt; These costs, such as pilotage and dockage fees, are typically borne by the shipowner.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bunker adjustment factor (BAF):&lt;/strong&gt; This is a surcharge that is added to the freight rate to cover the cost of fuel.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Speed premium:&lt;/strong&gt; This is a bonus that is paid to the shipowner if the ship sails at a faster speed than was agreed upon in the charter party.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Demurrage:&lt;/strong&gt; This is a charge that is paid to the shipowner for each day that the charterer exceeds the agreed-upon laytime for loading and discharging the cargo.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Other financial elements of charter parties&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;other-financial-elements-of-charter-parties&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#other-financial-elements-of-charter-parties&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to the financial elements mentioned above, charter parties may also include other financial provisions, such as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Advance payment:&lt;/strong&gt; The charterer may be required to pay the shipowner an advance payment to secure the charter. This advance payment is typically non-refundable if the charter is cancelled by the charterer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Performance bond:&lt;/strong&gt; The charterer may also be required to post a performance bond to guarantee their performance of the charter party. This performance bond is typically returned to the charterer once the charter party has been completed satisfactorily.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dispute resolution:&lt;/strong&gt; Charter parties typically include a dispute resolution clause that specifies how any disputes arising out of the charter party will be resolved. This clause may provide for arbitration, mediation, or litigation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#conclusion&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The financial elements of charter parties can be complex and vary depending on the specific terms agreed upon between the shipper and carrier. It is important to carefully review and understand the financial terms of any charter party before signing it. It is also a good idea to consult with a maritime lawyer or other shipping expert to ensure that your interests are protected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope this more comprehensive answer is helpful. Please let me know if you have any other questions.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;h2&gt;Fish Types&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;fish-types&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#fish-types&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Types of fish marine resources can be classified according to their body type, habitat, or commercial value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;According to body type:&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;according-to-body-type&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#according-to-body-type&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Bony fish:&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;bony-fish&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#bony-fish&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the largest group of fish, accounting for over 95% of all fish species. They have a skeleton made of bone and a swim bladder that helps them control their buoyancy. Examples of bony fish include tuna, cod, salmon, and herring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Cartilaginous fish:&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;cartilaginous-fish&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#cartilaginous-fish&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;This group includes sharks, rays, and skates. They have a skeleton made of cartilage, which is lighter and more flexible than bone. Cartilaginous fish also do not have a swim bladder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Jawless fish:&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;jawless-fish&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#jawless-fish&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the most primitive group of fish, and includes lampreys and hagfishes. They do not have jaws or paired fins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;According to habitat:&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;according-to-habitat&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;a href=&#34;#pelagic-fish&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;These fish live in the open ocean, away from the coast. Examples of pelagic fish include tuna, mackerel, and swordfish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Demersal fish:&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;demersal-fish&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#demersal-fish&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;These fish live on or near the bottom of the ocean. Examples of demersal fish include cod, haddock, and flounder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Reef fish:&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;reef-fish&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#reef-fish&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;These fish live in coral reefs and other rocky structures. Examples of reef fish include clownfish, parrotfish, and angelfish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;According to commercial value:&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;according-to-commercial-value&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#according-to-commercial-value&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Food fish:&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;food-fish&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#food-fish&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;These fish are caught and sold for human consumption. Examples of food fish include tuna, salmon, cod, and shrimp.&lt;/p&gt;

      <link>https://www.anirbanmarine.in/docs/partc/em301/marineres/marfish/fishfactory/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://www.anirbanmarine.in/docs/partc/em301/marineres/marfish/fishfactory/</guid>
      <description>
        
        
        &lt;h2&gt;What are Fishing Factory Vessels?&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;what-are-fishing-factory-vessels&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#what-are-fishing-factory-vessels&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fishing factory vessels (FFVs) are large ocean-going ships that are equipped to catch, process, and store fish. They are also known as fish processing vessels, mother ships, or floating factories. FFVs are typically used to fish in remote waters, where they can stay at sea for months at a time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FFVs are highly efficient fishing vessels that can catch and process large quantities of fish. They are also equipped with sophisticated freezing and storage facilities, which allow them to maintain the freshness of the fish. FFVs produce a wide variety of fish products, including frozen fillets, canned fish, fishmeal, and fish oil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FFVs play a major role in the global seafood industry. They account for a significant share of the world&amp;rsquo;s total fish catch. FFVs are particularly important for the fishing industries of developing countries, which often lack the resources to invest in large-scale fishing fleets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Types of FFVs&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;types-of-ffvs&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#types-of-ffvs&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are a variety of different types of FFVs, each of which is designed to fish for specific types of fish. Some of the most common types of FFVs include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Freezer trawlers:&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;freezer-trawlers&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#freezer-trawlers&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Freezer trawlers are large ships that are equipped with large nets that are dragged behind the ship to catch fish. The fish are then processed and frozen on board the ship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Longline factory vessels:&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;longline-factory-vessels&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#longline-factory-vessels&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Longline factory vessels use longlines, which are fishing lines with thousands of hooks attached. The longlines are baited and set out in the water. When a fish bites the hook, it is pulled up to the ship and processed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Purse seine freezer vessels:&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;purse-seine-freezer-vessels&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#purse-seine-freezer-vessels&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Purse seine freezer vessels use large nets to encircle schools of fish. The nets are then drawn together and the fish are pumped on board the ship for processing and freezing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Benefits of FFVs&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;benefits-of-ffvs&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#benefits-of-ffvs&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;FFVs offer a number of benefits over smaller fishing vessels. Some of the key benefits of FFVs include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Efficiency:&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;efficiency&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#efficiency&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;FFVs are highly efficient fishing vessels that can catch and process large quantities of fish. This is because they are equipped with state-of-the-art fishing gear and processing equipment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Sustainability:&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;sustainability&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#sustainability&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;FFVs can help to promote sustainable fishing practices. This is because they are able to fish in remote waters, where there is less competition for fish resources. Additionally, FFVs are required to comply with strict regulations that are designed to protect fish populations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Economic benefits:&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;economic-benefits&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#economic-benefits&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;FFVs provide significant economic benefits to the countries in which they operate. They create jobs, generate export revenue, and contribute to the local economy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Challenges of FFVs&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;challenges-of-ffvs&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#challenges-of-ffvs&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;FFVs also face a number of challenges, including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overfishing: FFVs have the potential to overfish fishstocks, particularly if they are not properly managed. It is important to ensure that FFVs operate within sustainable limits and that they comply with all applicable fishing regulations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Environmental impact: FFVs can have a negative impact on the environment, particularly when they operate in fragile ecosystems. For example, bottom trawling can damage seafloor habitats and fishing gear can entangle and kill marine mammals and other non-target species. It is important to minimize the environmental impact of FFVs by implementing responsible fishing practices and by using environmentally friendly fishing gear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Human rights concerns: There have been reports of human rights abuses on board some FFVs, including forced labor and child labor. It is important to ensure that FFVs operate in a responsible and ethical manner and that the rights of their crews are protected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, FFVs play an important role in the global seafood industry. However, it is important to manage them carefully to ensure that they operate in a sustainable and responsible manner.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;h2&gt;General characteristics of the seas&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;general-characteristics-of-the-seas&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#general-characteristics-of-the-seas&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seas are smaller bodies of water than oceans and are usually partially enclosed by land.
Seas are typically shallower than oceans, with an average depth of about 650 feet (200 meters).
The salinity of seas can vary depending on the location, but it is generally lower than the salinity of oceans.
Seas are home to a variety of marine life, including fish, shellfish, and seabirds.
Bottom topography of the seas&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The bottom topography of the seas can vary depending on the location. However, there are some general trends:&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;the-bottom-topography-of-the-seas-can-vary-depending-on-the-location-however-there-are-some-general-trends&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#the-bottom-topography-of-the-seas-can-vary-depending-on-the-location-however-there-are-some-general-trends&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The continental shelf is the submerged extension of a continent&amp;rsquo;s continental margin. It is typically a gently sloping plain that extends from the shoreline to the edge of the continental slope.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The continental slope is the steep slope that descends from the continental shelf to the ocean floor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ocean floor is the deepest part of the ocean and is located beneath the continental shelf and slope. The ocean floor is divided into three main regions: the abyssal plain, the mid-ocean ridges, and the deep-sea trenches.
Coastline and beaches&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The coastline&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;the-coastline&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#the-coastline&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;is the boundary between the land and the sea. Coastlines can be classified into two main types: erosional and depositional.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Erosional coastlines&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;erosional-coastlines&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#erosional-coastlines&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;are characterized by cliffs, rocky shores, and other features that have been created by the erosion of the land by the sea. Depositional coastlines are characterized by beaches, sand dunes, and other features that have been created by the deposition of sediment by the sea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Beaches&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;beaches&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#beaches&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;are narrow strips of sand or gravel that are located along the coastline. Beaches are formed by the deposition of sediment by the waves and currents. Beaches can vary in size and shape depending on the location and the type of sediment that is available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Conclusion&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#conclusion&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The seas are important ecosystems that provide a variety of benefits to humans, including food, recreation, and transportation. The bottom topography of the seas, the coastline, and the beaches are all important factors that influence the distribution of marine life and the availability of resources for humans.&lt;/p&gt;

It involves the construction of offshore drilling rigs or platforms, the use of specialized equipment and tools, and the implementation of strict safety and environmental protection measures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;General idea on drilling&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;general-idea-on-drilling&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#general-idea-on-drilling&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The first step in drilling for marine resources is to identify a potential drilling location.&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;the-first-step-in-drilling-for-marine-resources-is-to-identify-a-potential-drilling-location&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#the-first-step-in-drilling-for-marine-resources-is-to-identify-a-potential-drilling-location&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is done using a variety of methods, including seismic surveys and geological studies. Once a potential drilling location has been identified, a drilling rig or platform must be constructed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drilling rigs and platforms are large and complex structures that are designed to withstand the harsh conditions of the marine environment. They are also equipped with specialized equipment and tools for drilling wells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Once the drilling rig or platform is in place, a well can be drilled.&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;once-the-drilling-rig-or-platform-is-in-place-a-well-can-be-drilled&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#once-the-drilling-rig-or-platform-is-in-place-a-well-can-be-drilled&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The drilling process involves rotating a drill bit into the seabed to create a hole. As the drill bit rotates, it is fed with drilling fluid, which helps to cool the bit and remove cuttings from the hole.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the well has been drilled to the desired depth, it is lined with a steel casing to prevent it from collapsing. The casing is also used to seal off any oil or gas that may be present in the surrounding rock formations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the well has been cased, it is completed. This involves installing a wellhead and other equipment that will allow oil or gas to be produced from the well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Challenges of drilling for marine resources&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;challenges-of-drilling-for-marine-resources&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#challenges-of-drilling-for-marine-resources&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Drilling for oil and gas in marine environments is a challenging process for a number of reasons. One of the biggest challenges is the harsh conditions of the marine environment. Offshore drilling rigs and platforms must be designed to withstand high winds, waves, and currents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another challenge of drilling for marine resources is the depth of the water. Offshore drilling rigs and platforms can operate in water depths of up to 12,000 feet. Drilling in deep water requires the use of specialized equipment and tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Safety and environmental protection measures&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;safety-and-environmental-protection-measures&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#safety-and-environmental-protection-measures&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Safety and environmental protection are top priorities for the offshore drilling industry. Offshore drilling rigs and platforms are equipped with a variety of safety features, such as fire suppression systems and lifeboats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The offshore drilling industry also has a number of environmental protection measures in place. For example, drilling rigs and platforms are required to have spill prevention and response plans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conclusion&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drilling for oil and gas in marine environments is a complex and challenging process. However, it is an essential part of meeting the world&amp;rsquo;s growing energy needs. The offshore drilling industry is committed to safety and environmental protection, and is constantly developing new technologies to improve its operations.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;h2&gt;Discuss Genesis of Rocks&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;discuss-genesis-of-rocks&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#discuss-genesis-of-rocks&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rocks are formed through a variety of geological processes, which can be broadly classified into three main types:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Igneous rocks are formed from the cooling and solidification of molten magma or lava. Magma is generated within the Earth&amp;rsquo;s mantle, and can rise to the surface and erupt as lava, or cool and solidify underground. Igneous rocks are typically classified based on their composition and texture. Some common examples of igneous rocks include granite, basalt, and obsidian.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sedimentary rocks are formed from the accumulation and compaction of sediments. Sediments can be derived from the weathering and erosion of existing rocks, or from the precipitation of minerals from solution. Sedimentary rocks are typically classified based on their composition and texture. Some common examples of sedimentary rocks include sandstone, limestone, and shale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Metamorphic rocks are formed when existing rocks are subjected to high temperatures and pressures. This can happen during mountain building events, or when rocks are buried deeply within the Earth&amp;rsquo;s crust. Metamorphic rocks are typically classified based on their composition and texture. Some common examples of metamorphic rocks include marble, gneiss, and quartzite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Types of rocks&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;types-of-rocks&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#types-of-rocks&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are many different types of rocks, but they can be broadly classified into the three main types mentioned above: igneous, sedimentary, and metamorphic. Each of these main types can be further subdivided into smaller groups and types based on their composition, texture, and other characteristics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Igneous rocks can be divided into two main types: intrusive and extrusive. Intrusive igneous rocks cool and solidify slowly underground, while extrusive igneous rocks cool and solidify quickly at the surface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sedimentary rocks can be divided into three main types: clastic, chemical, and organic. Clastic sedimentary rocks are formed from fragments of other rocks, while chemical sedimentary rocks are formed from the precipitation of minerals from solution. Organic sedimentary rocks are formed from the remains of dead organisms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Metamorphic rocks can be divided into two main types: foliated and non-foliated. Foliated metamorphic rocks have a banded appearance, while non-foliated metamorphic rocks do not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Distribution of rocks in the continents and oceans&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;distribution-of-rocks-in-the-continents-and-oceans&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#distribution-of-rocks-in-the-continents-and-oceans&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The distribution of rocks on the Earth&amp;rsquo;s surface is not uniform. Igneous rocks are typically found in areas of recent volcanic activity, such as the mid-ocean ridges and the Pacific Ring of Fire. Sedimentary rocks are typically found in sedimentary basins, which are areas where sediments have accumulated over time. Metamorphic rocks are typically found in mountain ranges, where they have been subjected to high temperatures and pressures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In general, the continents are dominated by igneous and metamorphic rocks, while the oceans are dominated by sedimentary rocks. This is because the continents have been subjected to more geological activity over time than the oceans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some specific examples of the distribution of rocks in the continents and oceans:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;North America: The Rocky Mountains are composed of a variety of metamorphic rocks, while the Great Plains are covered in sedimentary rocks. The Appalachian Mountains are composed of a variety of igneous and metamorphic rocks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;South America: The Andes Mountains are composed of a variety of igneous and metamorphic rocks, while the Amazon rainforest is covered in sedimentary rocks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Europe: The Alps are composed of a variety of metamorphic rocks, while the North European Plain is covered in sedimentary rocks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asia: The Himalayas are composed of a variety of igneous and metamorphic rocks, while the Gobi Desert is covered in sedimentary rocks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Africa: The Great Rift Valley is composed of a variety of igneous rocks, while the Sahara Desert is covered in sedimentary rocks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Australia: The Great Dividing Range is composed of a variety of igneous and metamorphic rocks, while the Outback is covered in sedimentary rocks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oceans: The ocean floors are covered in a variety of sedimentary rocks, with some areas also containing igneous rocks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is important to note that the distribution of rocks on the Earth&amp;rsquo;s surface is constantly changing due to geological processes such as erosion, weathering, and plate tectonics.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;h2&gt;What are fishing grounds?&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;what-are-fishing-grounds&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#what-are-fishing-grounds&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fishing grounds are areas of the ocean where fish are abundant and can be caught commercially. They are typically located in areas where there is a lot of food for fish, such as near continental shelves, upwelling areas, and around coral reefs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The geographical location of fishing grounds varies depending on the type of fish being targeted. For example, tuna fishing grounds are typically located in tropical and subtropical waters, while cod fishing grounds are typically located in colder waters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Some of the most important fishing grounds in the world include:&lt;span class=&#34;absolute -mt-20&#34; id=&#34;some-of-the-most-important-fishing-grounds-in-the-world-include&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#some-of-the-most-important-fishing-grounds-in-the-world-include&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The North Atlantic, including the Gulf of Maine, the Grand Banks of Newfoundland, and the Norwegian Sea.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Northeast Pacific, including the Bering Sea and the Gulf of Alaska.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Northwest Pacific, including the East China Sea and the Yellow Sea.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Southeast Pacific, including the Humboldt Current and the Patagonian Shelf.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Southwest Atlantic, including the Falkland Islands and the Gulf of Guinea.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Indian Ocean, including the Arabian Sea and the Bay of Bengal.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These fishing grounds support a wide range of commercial fisheries, which provide food and jobs for millions of people around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, it is important to note that many fishing grounds are under pressure from overfishing and other threats. It is important to manage these resources sustainably to ensure that they remain productive for future generations.&lt;/p&gt;
