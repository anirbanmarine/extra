        &lt;p&gt;Agenda 21 is a comprehensive plan of action to achieve sustainable development. It was adopted by 178 governments at the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED) in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, in 1992. Agenda 21 is a non-binding document, but it has been influential in guiding sustainable development efforts around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Agenda 21 covers a wide range of issues, including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sustainable agriculture and rural development
Conservation of biological diversity
Combating deforestation
Protecting the atmosphere
Managing fragile ecosystems
Promoting sustainable energy use
Managing hazardous wastes
Promoting sustainable human settlements
Agenda 21 also emphasizes the importance of international cooperation and participation of all stakeholders in achieving sustainable development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The UNFCCC Agenda 21 is a subset of Agenda 21 that specifically addresses climate change. It outlines a series of actions that countries can take to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and adapt to the impacts of climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The UNFCCC Agenda 21 includes provisions for:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Developed countries to provide financial and technological assistance to developing countries to help them mitigate and adapt to climate change
All countries to develop national climate change action plans
Countries to cooperate in developing and implementing international climate change policies
The UNFCCC Agenda 21 has been influential in shaping the international response to climate change. It has helped to raise awareness of the issue and has provided a framework for international cooperation on climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Current status of the UNFCCC Agenda 21&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The UNFCCC Agenda 21 is still relevant today. The world is still facing significant challenges in addressing climate change, and the UNFCCC Agenda 21 provides a roadmap for how to address these challenges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Countries are making progress in implementing the UNFCCC Agenda 21, but more needs to be done. Developed countries need to provide more financial and technological assistance to developing countries, and all countries need to do more to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and adapt to the impacts of climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Significance of the UNFCCC Agenda 21&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The UNFCCC Agenda 21 is a significant document because it provides a comprehensive framework for addressing climate change. It is also significant because it was adopted by consensus by all UNFCCC member states, which shows that there is a strong international commitment to addressing climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The UNFCCC Agenda 21 has been influential in shaping the international response to climate change. It has helped to raise awareness of the issue and has provided a framework for international cooperation on climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The UNFCCC Agenda 21 is still relevant today, and countries need to continue to implement its provisions in order to address the challenges of climate change.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Kyoto Protocol-UNFCCC (UNFCCC,Kyoto,1997)</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/docs/partc/em301/intconv/kyotoproto/</link>

      <description>
        
        
        &lt;p&gt;The Kyoto Protocol is an international treaty that was adopted in 1997 at the Third Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in Kyoto, Japan. It entered into force in 2005 and has been ratified by 192 countries, including India.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Kyoto Protocol is the first international treaty to set binding targets for the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. It commits developed countries to reduce their emissions by an average of 5.2% below 1990 levels by the first commitment period, 2008-2012.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Kyoto Protocol includes a number of mechanisms to help countries achieve their emissions targets, including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Emissions trading: Countries can trade emissions permits with each other, so that countries that can reduce their emissions more cheaply can sell permits to countries that find it more difficult or expensive to reduce their emissions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Joint implementation: Countries can work together to implement projects that reduce emissions in other countries.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Clean development mechanism: Developed countries can invest in projects that reduce emissions in developing countries, and then count the emissions reductions towards their own targets.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Kyoto Protocol has played an important role in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and promoting international cooperation on climate change. However, it has also been criticized for not being ambitious enough and for not including all major emitters, such as the United States.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some of the key achievements of the Kyoto Protocol:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Kyoto Protocol has helped to raise awareness of the importance of reducing greenhouse gas emissions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Kyoto Protocol has established a global framework for international cooperation on climate change.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Kyoto Protocol has promoted the development of new technologies and markets for clean energy and energy efficiency.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Kyoto Protocol has helped to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from developed countries.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Kyoto Protocol is an important tool for addressing climate change. However, it is important to note that the first commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol ended in 2012 and that a new agreement, the Paris Agreement, was adopted in 2015. The Paris Agreement sets out a new framework for international cooperation on climate change, with the goal of limiting the global temperature rise to well below 2 degrees Celsius, preferably to 1.5 degrees Celsius, compared to pre-industrial levels.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <description>
        
        
        &lt;p&gt;The Regional Seas Programme (RSP) is a global partnership of 14 Regional Seas Conventions and Action Plans (RSCAPs) that work to protect and manage the marine and coastal environment. The RSP is coordinated by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and is funded by a variety of sources, including governments, international organizations, and the private sector.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The RSP was launched in 1974 at the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment in Stockholm. The first RSCAP was established in the Mediterranean Sea in 1976, and since then, RSCAPs have been established in all major ocean regions around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The RSP takes an ecosystem-based approach to marine and coastal management. This means that it takes into account the interconnectedness of all components of the marine and coastal environment, including humans. The RSP works to protect and manage the marine and coastal environment through a variety of activities, including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Developing and implementing regional action plans to address specific marine and coastal environmental problems
Providing technical assistance and capacity building to developing countries
Promoting public awareness and education about marine and coastal environmental issues
Facilitating cooperation and coordination between different stakeholders
The RSP has played a significant role in protecting and managing the marine and coastal environment. It has helped to reduce pollution, protect biodiversity, and promote sustainable development in coastal communities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Paris 2015, the RSP was recognized as an important tool for implementing the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The SDGs are a set of 17 goals adopted by all United Nations Member States in 2015 as a blueprint to achieve a better and more sustainable future for all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The RSP is particularly relevant to the following SDGs:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SDG 6: Ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all
SDG 14: Conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources for sustainable development
SDG 15: Protect, restore and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, and halt and reverse land degradation and halt biodiversity loss
The RSP is committed to working with all stakeholders to implement the SDGs and achieve a more sustainable future for the marine and coastal environment.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;##Rio+10&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 2002 World Summit on Sustainable Development (WSSD), also known as Rio+10, was held in Johannesburg, South Africa, from 26 August to 4 September 2002. It was a follow-up to the 1992 Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Rio+10 Summit was attended by over 100 heads of state and government, as well as representatives from civil society and the private sector. It focused on the implementation of the outcomes of the 1992 Earth Summit, and on identifying new challenges and opportunities for sustainable development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Rio+10 Summit produced a number of outcomes, including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Johannesburg Declaration on Sustainable Development, which reaffirmed the commitment of world leaders to sustainable development and set out a number of goals and targets to be achieved by 2015.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Plan of Implementation, which provided a detailed blueprint for implementing the Johannesburg Declaration.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Type II Partnerships, which were voluntary agreements between governments, businesses, and civil society organizations to work together on specific sustainable development projects.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Rio+10 Summit was a significant event in the history of sustainable development. It helped to raise awareness of the importance of sustainable development and to mobilize global action on the issue. However, it is important to note that many of the goals and targets set at the Rio+10 Summit were not achieved, and that the world still faces a number of challenges in achieving sustainable development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;##Rio+20&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 2012 United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development (UNCSD), also known as Rio+20, was held in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, from 20 to 22 June 2012. It was a follow-up to the 1992 Earth Summit and the 2002 Rio+10 Summit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Rio+20 Conference was attended by over 100 heads of state and government, as well as representatives from civil society and the private sector. It focused on the following three themes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Green economy in the context of sustainable development and poverty eradication.
Institutional framework for sustainable development.
The new challenges of sustainable development.
The Rio+20 Conference produced a number of outcomes, including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Future We Want, an outcome document that reaffirmed the commitment of world leaders to sustainable development and set out a number of goals and targets to be achieved.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The 10-Year Framework of Programmes on Sustainable Consumption and Production Patterns (10YFP), which provided a framework for international cooperation on sustainable consumption and production.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Intergovernmental Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES), an independent intergovernmental body to assess the state of biodiversity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Rio+20 Conference was a significant event in the history of sustainable development. It helped to renew the commitment of world leaders to sustainable development and to lay the foundation for a new era of sustainable development. However, it is important to note that many of the goals and targets set at the Rio+20 Conference have not yet been achieved, and that the world still faces a number of challenges in achieving sustainable development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Legacy of Rio+10 and Rio+20&lt;span class=&#34;hx-absolute -hx-mt-20&#34; id=&#34;legacy-of-rio10-and-rio20&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#legacy-of-rio10-and-rio20&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Rio+10 and Rio+20 Summits were important events in the history of sustainable development. They helped to raise awareness of the importance of sustainable development, to mobilize global action on the issue, and to lay the foundation for a new era of sustainable development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, it is important to note that many of the goals and targets set at the Rio+10 and Rio+20 Summits have not yet been achieved. The world still faces a number of challenges in achieving sustainable development, including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Poverty and inequality&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Climate change&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Biodiversity loss&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pollution&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Resource scarcity
Despite these challenges, there is also a growing awareness of the importance of sustainable development and a growing commitment to achieving it. The Rio+10 and Rio+20 Summits played an important role in promoting sustainable development, and their legacy continues to inspire people around the world to work towards a more sustainable future.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <description>
        
        
        &lt;p&gt;The Commission on Sustainable Development (CSD) was a functional commission of the United Nations Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) that was established in 1992 following the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro. The CSD was tasked with reviewing the implementation of Agenda 21, the global plan for sustainable development that was adopted at the Earth Summit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The Global Environment Facility (GEF) is an international financial institution that was established in 1992 to provide &amp;gt;funding for projects that address global environmental problems. The GEF is one of the financial mechanisms of the CSD, &amp;gt;and it plays an important role in supporting the implementation of Agenda 21.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The GEF provides funding for projects in a number of areas, including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Climate change&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Biodiversity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;International waters&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Land degradation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Chemicals and waste&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Persistent organic pollutants (POPs)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The GEF works with a variety of partners, including governments, civil society organizations, and the private sector, to implement its projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CSD was abolished in 2013 and its functions were transferred to the High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF). The HLPF is the global forum for reviewing the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The GEF continues to play an important role in supporting the implementation of the SDGs. It is the largest provider of grants to developing countries for environmental projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some examples of how the GEF has supported the implementation of Agenda 21:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The GEF has provided funding for projects to protect and restore forests, which play an important role in mitigating climate change and conserving biodiversity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The GEF has provided funding for projects to improve water quality and management, which is essential for human health and sustainable development.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The GEF has provided funding for projects to reduce pollution and protect the environment from hazardous chemicals and waste.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The GEF is a key partner in the global effort to achieve sustainable development. It plays an important role in supporting the implementation of Agenda 21 and the SDGs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>The Intergovernmental Conference on biological diversity beyond national jurisdiction (BBNJ,2023)</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/docs/partc/em301/intconv/bbnj/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/docs/partc/em301/intconv/bbnj/</guid>
      <description>
        
        
        &lt;p&gt;The Intergovernmental Conference on biological diversity beyond national jurisdiction (BBNJ) concluded on June 19, 2023, with the adoption of a landmark agreement to conserve and sustainably use marine biodiversity in areas beyond national jurisdiction (ABNJ). The agreement, which was adopted by consensus by the 193 member states of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), is the first comprehensive international treaty to address marine biodiversity in ABNJ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The BBNJ agreement covers a wide range of issues, including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Marine protected areas (MPAs): The agreement establishes a process for establishing and managing MPAs in ABNJ, including large-scale MPAs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Environmental impact assessments (EIAs): The agreement requires EIAs to be conducted for all activities that have the potential to significantly impact marine biodiversity in ABNJ.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Capacity building and technology transfer: The agreement includes provisions to help developing countries build their capacity to implement the agreement and to gain access to relevant technologies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The BBNJ agreement is a significant achievement for the conservation of marine biodiversity. It is estimated that ABNJ accounts for over half of the Earth&amp;rsquo;s surface and is home to a vast array of marine life, much of which is still unknown to science. The agreement will help to protect this biodiversity from the growing threats of climate change, overfishing, and pollution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Current status of the BBNJ agreement&lt;span class=&#34;hx-absolute -hx-mt-20&#34; id=&#34;current-status-of-the-bbnj-agreement&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#current-status-of-the-bbnj-agreement&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of October 1, 2023, the BBNJ agreement has been signed by 92 countries and regional economic integration organizations. However, it has not yet been ratified by any country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Significance of the BBNJ agreement&lt;span class=&#34;hx-absolute -hx-mt-20&#34; id=&#34;significance-of-the-bbnj-agreement&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#significance-of-the-bbnj-agreement&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The BBNJ agreement is a significant achievement for the conservation of marine biodiversity. It is the first comprehensive international treaty to address marine biodiversity in ABNJ, which covers over half of the Earth&amp;rsquo;s surface. The agreement will help to protect this biodiversity from the growing threats of climate change, overfishing, and pollution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The BBNJ agreement is also significant because it was adopted by consensus by the 193 member states of UNCLOS. This shows that there is a strong international commitment to conserving marine biodiversity in ABNJ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Next steps&lt;span class=&#34;hx-absolute -hx-mt-20&#34; id=&#34;next-steps&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#next-steps&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next step for the BBNJ agreement is for countries to ratify it. Once 30 countries have ratified the agreement, it will enter into force.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Countries are encouraged to ratify the BBNJ agreement as soon as possible to ensure that its benefits can be realized as soon as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>
        
        
        &lt;p&gt;The London Convention on the Prevention of Marine Pollution by Dumping of Wastes and Other Matter (LC 1972) is a global treaty adopted in 1972 to protect the marine environment from human activities, including the dumping of wastes. The Convention entered into force in 1975 and currently has 87 Contracting Parties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The London Convention prohibits the dumping of certain hazardous materials, such as organohalogen compounds, mercury, cadmium, persistent plastics, and radioactive wastes. It also requires a prior special permit for the dumping of certain other materials, such as industrial wastes and dredged material.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1996, the London Protocol was adopted to further modernize the Convention and, eventually, replace it. The Protocol prohibits all dumping, except for possibly acceptable wastes on the so-called &amp;ldquo;reverse list&amp;rdquo;. The London Protocol entered into force in 2006 and currently has 52 Contracting Parties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The London Convention and Protocol play an important role in protecting the marine environment from pollution caused by dumping. By prohibiting or regulating the dumping of certain wastes, the Conventions help to ensure that the oceans remain clean and healthy for future generations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Here are some of the key achievements of the London Convention and Protocol:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The dumping of radioactive wastes at sea has been banned since 1993.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The dumping of industrial wastes at sea was phased out by 1995.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The incineration of wastes at sea has been banned since 1994.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The dumping of persistent plastics at sea has been prohibited since 2010.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The London Convention and Protocol have helped to reduce the amount of marine debris, such as plastic bags and bottles, in the oceans.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Conventions have also helped to improve the quality of seawater and seabed sediments in many parts of the world.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The London Convention and Protocol are important tools for protecting the marine environment from pollution caused by dumping. By working together, the Contracting Parties to the Conventions can help to ensure that the oceans remain clean and healthy for all.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED),1992</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/docs/partc/em301/intconv/unced/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>
        
        
        &lt;p&gt;The United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED), also known as the Earth Summit, was a major United Nations conference held in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, from June 3 to 14, 1992. It was the largest gathering of world leaders as of 1992, with 117 heads of state and representatives of 178 nations in all attending.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Earth Summit was convened in recognition of the growing interdependence of the environment and development. It was a landmark event in the history of international environmental cooperation, and it produced a number of important agreements, including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Rio Declaration on Environment and Development, which sets out 27 principles for sustainable development, including the principle that &amp;ldquo;human beings are at the centre of concerns for sustainable development.&amp;rdquo;
The Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), which is the main international treaty for addressing climate change.
The Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), which is the main international treaty for addressing the loss of biodiversity.
Agenda 21, a comprehensive plan for sustainable development that covers a wide range of issues, including poverty, hunger, health, education, and environmental protection.
The Earth Summit was a major step forward in international environmental cooperation, but it is important to note that the agreements it produced are not legally binding. This means that countries are not obligated to implement them, but they do provide a framework for international action on sustainable development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Earth Summit also had a significant impact on public awareness of environmental issues. It helped to put sustainable development on the global agenda and to inspire people around the world to take action to protect the environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 30th anniversary of the Earth Summit will be celebrated in 2022. This is an opportunity to reflect on the progress that has been made in the past 30 years and to identify the challenges that remain. It is also an opportunity to renew our commitment to sustainable development and to build a better future for all.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD,Rio,1992) </title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/docs/partc/em301/intconv/unconvbiodiversity/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>
        
        
        &lt;p&gt;The United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) is an international treaty that aims to promote sustainable development. It was adopted at the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro in 1992 and has been ratified by 196 countries, including India.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CBD has three main objectives:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The conservation of biological diversity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The sustainable use of its components.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The fair and equitable sharing of the benefits arising from the use of genetic resources.
The CBD is a comprehensive treaty that covers all aspects of biological diversity, from ecosystems to species to genes. It also covers biotechnology and the fair and equitable sharing of benefits from the use of genetic resources.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CBD is implemented through a number of mechanisms, including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;National Biodiversity Strategies and Action Plans (NBSAPs): NBSAPs are national plans that outline how each country will implement the CBD.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Conference of the Parties (COP): The COP is the supreme decision-making body of the CBD. It meets every two years to review the implementation of the Convention and to make decisions on new initiatives.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Subsidiary Body on Scientific, Technical and Technological Advice (SBSTTA): SBSTTA is a scientific advisory body that provides advice to the COP on scientific, technical, and technological matters related to the CBD.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Subsidiary Body on Implementation (SBI): SBI is an implementation advisory body that provides advice to the COP on the implementation of the CBD.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The CBD has played an important role in promoting the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity around the world. However, there are still a number of challenges that need to be addressed, such as the loss of biodiversity due to habitat loss, climate change, and invasive species.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some of the key achievements of the CBD:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The CBD has helped to raise awareness of the importance of biological diversity and the need to protect it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The CBD has promoted the development of national biodiversity strategies and action plans, which have helped to guide countries in their efforts to conserve and sustainably use biological diversity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The CBD has established a number of mechanisms for international cooperation on biological diversity, such as the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) and the Clearing-House Mechanism.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The CBD has helped to promote the fair and equitable sharing of benefits from the use of genetic resources.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The CBD is an important tool for protecting biological diversity and promoting sustainable development. It is essential that all parties continue to work together to implement the Convention effectively.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC,Rio,1992)</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/docs/partc/em301/intconv/unfccc/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>
        
        
        &lt;p&gt;The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) is an international treaty that was adopted in 1992 at the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. It entered into force in 1994 and has been ratified by 198 countries, including India.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The UNFCCC is a landmark agreement that sets out the global framework for addressing climate change. It recognizes that climate change is a common concern of humankind and that all countries have a responsibility to address it. However, it also acknowledges that countries have different capabilities and responsibilities in addressing climate change, and that developed countries should take the lead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The UNFCCC has two main objectives:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To stabilize greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To achieve this objective within a time-frame sufficient to allow ecosystems to adapt naturally to climate change, to ensure that food production is not threatened and to enable economic development to proceed in a sustainable manner.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The UNFCCC is implemented through a number of mechanisms, including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;National communications: Parties to the UNFCCC are required to submit national communications on a regular basis. These communications provide information on greenhouse gas emissions, mitigation and adaptation measures, and financial and technological needs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Conference of the Parties (COP): The COP is the supreme decision-making body of the UNFCCC. It meets every year to review the implementation of the Convention and to make decisions on new initiatives.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Subsidiary Body on Scientific, Technical and Technological Advice (SBSTA): SBSTA is a scientific advisory body that provides advice to the COP on scientific, technical, and technological matters related to the UNFCCC.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Subsidiary Body on Implementation (SBI): SBI is an implementation advisory body that provides advice to the COP on the implementation of the UNFCCC.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The UNFCCC has played an important role in promoting international cooperation on climate change. However, there are still a number of challenges that need to be addressed, such as reducing greenhouse gas emissions to limit the global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius, and providing financial and technological support to developing countries to help them adapt to the impacts of climate change.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some of the key achievements of the UNFCCC:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The UNFCCC has helped to raise awareness of the importance of climate change and the need to address it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The UNFCCC has established a global framework for international cooperation on climate change.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The UNFCCC has promoted the development of national climate change policies and plans.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The UNFCCC has helped to mobilize financial and technological resources to support developing countries in their efforts to mitigate and adapt to climate change.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The UNFCCC is an important tool for addressing climate change. It is essential that all parties continue to work together to implement the Convention effectively.&lt;/li&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;The United Nations Conference on the Human Environment, also known as the Stockholm Conference, was held in Stockholm, Sweden, from June 5-16, 1972. It was the first major international conference to address environmental issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The conference was attended by representatives from 113 countries, and resulted in the adoption of the Stockholm Declaration, an Action Plan for the Human Environment, and several resolutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Stockholm Declaration is a landmark document in environmental law. It contains 26 principles that outline the rights and responsibilities of states in protecting the environment. Some of the key principles of the Stockholm Declaration include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Man has the fundamental right to freedom, equality and adequate conditions of life, in an environment of a quality that permits a life of dignity and well-being.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;States have, in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations and the principles of international law, the sovereign right to exploit their own resources pursuant to their own environmental policies, and the responsibility to ensure that activities within their jurisdiction or control do not cause damage to the environment of other States or of areas beyond the limits of national jurisdiction.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The natural resources of the earth, including air, water, land, flora and fauna and especially representative samples of natural ecosystems, must be safeguarded for the benefit of present and future generations through careful planning or management, as appropriate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Action Plan for the Human Environment is a comprehensive document that sets out a series of recommendations for addressing environmental problems at the national and international levels. The plan includes recommendations on a wide range of issues, including pollution control, natural resource management, and environmental education.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Stockholm Conference was a watershed moment in the global environmental movement. It helped to raise awareness of environmental problems and to promote international cooperation in addressing them. The principles and recommendations of the Stockholm Conference continue to guide environmental policy and law around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Significance of the United Nations Convention on Human Environment, 1972&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;The United Nations Convention on Human Environment, 1972, was a landmark event in the history of environmental protection. It was the first major international conference to address environmental issues, and it resulted in the adoption of a number of important documents, including the Stockholm Declaration and the Action Plan for the Human Environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Stockholm Declaration is a landmark document in environmental law. It contains 26 principles that outline the rights and responsibilities of states in protecting the environment. The principles of the Stockholm Declaration have been incorporated into many other international environmental agreements and national environmental laws.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Action Plan for the Human Environment is a comprehensive document that sets out a series of recommendations for addressing environmental problems at the national and international levels. The plan includes recommendations on a wide range of issues, including pollution control, natural resource management, and environmental education.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United Nations Convention on Human Environment, 1972, was a watershed moment in the global environmental movement. It helped to lay the foundation for the development of international environmental law and policy. The conference also helped to raise awareness of environmental problems and to promote international cooperation in addressing them.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;a href=&#34;#open-close&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;These sources are typically used for long-term projects, such as purchasing assets, expanding operations, or financing large-scale initiatives. Below is an explanation of the key long-term sources of finance, along with examples and distinctive features. Additionally, I will discuss the specific options available for &lt;strong&gt;financing ships&lt;/strong&gt;, which is a specialized area of finance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Long-Term Sources of Finance for Organizations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;hx-absolute -hx-mt-20&#34; id=&#34;long-term-sources-of-finance-for-organizations&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

Equity Financing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;hx-absolute -hx-mt-20&#34; id=&#34;1-equity-financing&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#1-equity-financing&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Description&lt;/strong&gt;: Raising capital by issuing shares to investors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Examples&lt;/strong&gt;:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Initial Public Offering (IPO)&lt;/strong&gt;: A company goes public by listing its shares on a stock exchange (e.g., Tesla&amp;rsquo;s IPO in 2010).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Private Equity&lt;/strong&gt;: Selling shares to private investors or venture capitalists (e.g., startups raising funds from venture capital firms).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Distinctive Features&lt;/strong&gt;:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No obligation to repay the funds.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Investors become partial owners and share in profits (dividends).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dilution of ownership and control.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Debt Financing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;hx-absolute -hx-mt-20&#34; id=&#34;2-debt-financing&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#2-debt-financing&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Description&lt;/strong&gt;: Borrowing funds that must be repaid over time with interest.&lt;/li&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;The National Waterways Act of 2016 is a landmark legislation in India aimed at developing and regulating inland waterways for shipping and navigation. Here are its salient features:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Expansion of National Waterways&lt;span class=&#34;hx-absolute -hx-mt-20&#34; id=&#34;expansion-of-national-waterways&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#expansion-of-national-waterways&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It significantly increased the number of declared National Waterways from the existing 5 to &lt;strong&gt;111&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This expansion covers a total navigable length of over &lt;strong&gt;20,000 km&lt;/strong&gt; across 24 states.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Act merges the five existing Acts that declared the initial National Waterways.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Declaration of New National Waterways&lt;span class=&#34;hx-absolute -hx-mt-20&#34; id=&#34;declaration-of-new-national-waterways&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#declaration-of-new-national-waterways&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Act identifies and declares &lt;strong&gt;106 new inland waterways&lt;/strong&gt; as National Waterways in addition to the existing five.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;Schedule&lt;/strong&gt; to the Act specifies all 111 National Waterways along with their geographical limits.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Central Government Jurisdiction&lt;span class=&#34;hx-absolute -hx-mt-20&#34; id=&#34;central-government-jurisdiction&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#central-government-jurisdiction&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;regulation and development&lt;/strong&gt; of all declared National Waterways fall under the exclusive jurisdiction of the Central Government.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Role of the Inland Waterways Authority of India (IWAI)&lt;span class=&#34;hx-absolute -hx-mt-20&#34; id=&#34;role-of-the-inland-waterways-authority-of-india-iwai&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#role-of-the-inland-waterways-authority-of-india-iwai&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Act designates the &lt;strong&gt;Inland Waterways Authority of India (IWAI)&lt;/strong&gt; as the primary body responsible for the development, maintenance, and regulation of these National Waterways.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It amends the &lt;strong&gt;Inland Waterways Authority of India Act, 1985&lt;/strong&gt;, to reflect the expanded list of National Waterways.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Objectives&lt;span class=&#34;hx-absolute -hx-mt-20&#34; id=&#34;objectives&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#objectives&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To promote &lt;strong&gt;inland water transport&lt;/strong&gt; as a cost-effective, fuel-efficient, and environment-friendly mode of transportation, especially for bulk goods and over-dimensional cargo.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To integrate inland waterways with other modes of transport like road and rail for seamless &lt;strong&gt;multimodal transportation&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To enhance &lt;strong&gt;connectivity&lt;/strong&gt; and boost trade and tourism.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To reduce &lt;strong&gt;congestion&lt;/strong&gt; on roads and railways.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To contribute to &lt;strong&gt;economic growth&lt;/strong&gt; by reducing logistics costs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Regulatory Framework&lt;span class=&#34;hx-absolute -hx-mt-20&#34; id=&#34;regulatory-framework&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#regulatory-framework&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Act provides a framework for regulating &lt;strong&gt;inland vessel construction, navigation safety, and environmental protection&lt;/strong&gt; on National Waterways.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Central Government is empowered to make rules regarding vessel registration, manning and crew standards, and waste management.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Repeal and Saving&lt;span class=&#34;hx-absolute -hx-mt-20&#34; id=&#34;repeal-and-saving&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#repeal-and-saving&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Act &lt;strong&gt;repeals&lt;/strong&gt; previous Acts that specifically declared the initial five National Waterways.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It ensures &lt;strong&gt;continuity&lt;/strong&gt; by stating that actions taken under the repealed Acts, if consistent with the new Act, are considered to have been taken under this Act.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Implementation&lt;span class=&#34;hx-absolute -hx-mt-20&#34; id=&#34;implementation&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#implementation&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;Central Government&lt;/strong&gt;, through the Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Waterways, is responsible for implementing the Act in conjunction with the IWAI.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In essence, the National Waterways Act, 2016, provides a comprehensive legal framework to unlock the potential of India&amp;rsquo;s inland waterways, aiming for a more integrated, efficient, and sustainable transportation network.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s the derivation for the relationship between geocentric latitude (ψ) and geographic latitude (φ):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reference Surfaces and Ellipsoid Parameters:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We&amp;rsquo;ll consider the Earth approximated by an oblate spheroid represented by an ellipsoid.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The ellipsoid has an equatorial radius (a) and a polar radius (b), with a &amp;gt; b due to the Earth&amp;rsquo;s bulge.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Geometry:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Geographic Latitude (φ):&lt;/strong&gt; Imagine a point P on the Earth&amp;rsquo;s surface.  Draw a line from P to the center of the Earth (O), designated PO.  Extend this line further upwards to pierce the equatorial plane at point Q.   Angle φ is the geographic latitude, which is the angle between the equatorial plane (EQ) and the line normal (perpendicular) to the ellipsoid at point P.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Geocentric Latitude (ψ):&lt;/strong&gt;  Again, consider point P on the surface. Draw line PO connecting P to the Earth&amp;rsquo;s center (O). Angle ψ is the geocentric latitude, which is the angle between the equatorial plane (EQ) and line PO.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Relating the Angles:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ellipsoid Normality:&lt;/strong&gt;  Line OP is normal (perpendicular) to the ellipsoid&amp;rsquo;s surface at point P. This implies that angle OPQ (represented by ε) is 90 degrees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Angle Relationships:&lt;/strong&gt; Angles φ + ε and ψ sum to 90 degrees because OQ and OP lie on a straight line.  Therefore:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;hextra-code-block hx-relative hx-mt-6 first:hx-mt-0 hx-group/code&#34;&gt;
  

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;ψ &amp;#43; ε = 90°  (Equation 1)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;hextra-code-copy-btn-container hx-opacity-0 hx-transition group-hover/code:hx-opacity-100 hx-flex hx-gap-1 hx-absolute hx-m-[11px] hx-right-0 hx-top-0&#34;&gt;
  &lt;button
    class=&#34;hextra-code-copy-btn hx-group/copybtn hx-transition-all active:hx-opacity-50 hx-bg-primary-700/5 hx-border hx-border-black/5 hx-text-gray-600 hover:hx-text-gray-900 hx-rounded-md hx-p-1.5 dark:hx-bg-primary-300/10 dark:hx-border-white/10 dark:hx-text-gray-400 dark:hover:hx-text-gray-50&#34;
    title=&#34;Copy code&#34;
  &gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;copy-icon group-[.copied]/copybtn:hx-hidden hx-pointer-events-none hx-h-4 hx-w-4&#34;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;success-icon hx-hidden group-[.copied]/copybtn:hx-block hx-pointer-events-none hx-h-4 hx-w-4&#34;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/button&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

  
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Relating Ellipsoid Geometry to ε:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ellipsoid and Point P:&lt;/strong&gt;  Since P is on the ellipsoid&amp;rsquo;s surface, point P is a distance &amp;lsquo;a&amp;rsquo; from the center (O) along the equatorial plane and a distance &amp;lsquo;b&amp;rsquo; from the center (O) along the polar axis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Triangle OPQ:&lt;/strong&gt; Triangle OPQ is a right triangle with right angle at Q.  We can use trigonometry to relate side lengths and angle ε.  In this case, we&amp;rsquo;ll use the sine function (sin) because ε is opposite to side PQ and adjacent to side OP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;hextra-code-block hx-relative hx-mt-6 first:hx-mt-0 hx-group/code&#34;&gt;
  

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;sin(ε) = PQ / OP  (Equation 2)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;hextra-code-copy-btn-container hx-opacity-0 hx-transition group-hover/code:hx-opacity-100 hx-flex hx-gap-1 hx-absolute hx-m-[11px] hx-right-0 hx-top-0&#34;&gt;
  &lt;button
    class=&#34;hextra-code-copy-btn hx-group/copybtn hx-transition-all active:hx-opacity-50 hx-bg-primary-700/5 hx-border hx-border-black/5 hx-text-gray-600 hover:hx-text-gray-900 hx-rounded-md hx-p-1.5 dark:hx-bg-primary-300/10 dark:hx-border-white/10 dark:hx-text-gray-400 dark:hover:hx-text-gray-50&#34;

  &gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;copy-icon group-[.copied]/copybtn:hx-hidden hx-pointer-events-none hx-h-4 hx-w-4&#34;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;success-icon hx-hidden group-[.copied]/copybtn:hx-block hx-pointer-events-none hx-h-4 hx-w-4&#34;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/button&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

  
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;3&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PQ from Ellipsoid:&lt;/strong&gt;  From the ellipsoid definition, distance PQ is equal to the difference between the equatorial radius (a) and the distance from the center (O) to point P along the polar axis.  This distance along the polar axis is often denoted by &amp;lsquo;z&amp;rsquo;.  Therefore:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;hextra-code-block hx-relative hx-mt-6 first:hx-mt-0 hx-group/code&#34;&gt;
  

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;PQ = a - z&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;hextra-code-copy-btn-container hx-opacity-0 hx-transition group-hover/code:hx-opacity-100 hx-flex hx-gap-1 hx-absolute hx-m-[11px] hx-right-0 hx-top-0&#34;&gt;

    &lt;div class=&#34;success-icon hx-hidden group-[.copied]/copybtn:hx-block hx-pointer-events-none hx-h-4 hx-w-4&#34;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/button&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

  
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;4&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;z from φ:&lt;/strong&gt; We can relate distance &amp;lsquo;z&amp;rsquo; to geographic latitude (φ) using the concept of flattening.  Imagine a sphere inscribed within the ellipsoid, tangent to it at the equator. The distance from the center (O) to the equator on this sphere would be exactly &amp;lsquo;a&amp;rsquo;.  As we move away from the equator towards the poles, the ellipsoid bulges outwards compared to the inscribed sphere. Distance &amp;lsquo;z&amp;rsquo; represents the distance between the ellipsoid surface at point P and the surface of the inscribed sphere at the same latitude. There are various ways to calculate &amp;lsquo;z&amp;rsquo; depending on the specific ellipsoid model being used. A common approach uses the following formula:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;hextra-code-block hx-relative hx-mt-6 first:hx-mt-0 hx-group/code&#34;&gt;
  

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;z = b * [1 - (1 - e^2) * sin^2(φ)]^(1/2)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;hextra-code-copy-btn-container hx-opacity-0 hx-transition group-hover/code:hx-opacity-100 hx-flex hx-gap-1 hx-absolute hx-m-[11px] hx-right-0 hx-top-0&#34;&gt;

    class=&#34;hextra-code-copy-btn hx-group/copybtn hx-transition-all active:hx-opacity-50 hx-bg-primary-700/5 hx-border hx-border-black/5 hx-text-gray-600 hover:hx-text-gray-900 hx-rounded-md hx-p-1.5 dark:hx-bg-primary-300/10 dark:hx-border-white/10 dark:hx-text-gray-400 dark:hover:hx-text-gray-50&#34;

  &lt;/button&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

  
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;where &amp;rsquo;e&amp;rsquo; is the eccentricity of the ellipse, defined as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;hextra-code-block hx-relative hx-mt-6 first:hx-mt-0 hx-group/code&#34;&gt;
  

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;e = sqrt(1 - (b^2 / a^2))&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;hextra-code-copy-btn-container hx-opacity-0 hx-transition group-hover/code:hx-opacity-100 hx-flex hx-gap-1 hx-absolute hx-m-[11px] hx-right-0 hx-top-0&#34;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Substituting and Simplifying:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/button&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

  
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;2&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Substitute Equation 5 (PQ formula) and OP (which is simply the equatorial radius &amp;lsquo;a&amp;rsquo;) into Equation 2 (sin(ε) formula):&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;hextra-code-block hx-relative hx-mt-6 first:hx-mt-0 hx-group/code&#34;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

  
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;3&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using trigonometric identities, we can rewrite sin(ε) as 1 - cos(ε)^2. Substitute this and rearrange the equation to solve for cos(ε):&lt;/li&gt;

  &lt;/button&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

  
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Relating ε to ψ:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Substitute Equation 1 (ψ + ε = 90°) and solve for cos(ε):&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;hextra-code-block hx-relative hx-mt-6 first:hx-mt-0 hx-group/code&#34;&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Tides can be classified in a number of ways, including by frequency, range, and type.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Frequency&lt;span class=&#34;hx-absolute -hx-mt-20&#34; id=&#34;frequency&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#frequency&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tides can be classified by frequency based on the number of high and low tides that occur each day. The three main types of tidal frequencies are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Diurnal tides:&lt;/strong&gt; One high tide and one low tide per day.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Semi-diurnal tides:&lt;/strong&gt; Two high tides and two low tides per day.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mixed tides:&lt;/strong&gt; A combination of diurnal and semi-diurnal tides, with the number of high and low tides varying per day.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Range&lt;span class=&#34;hx-absolute -hx-mt-20&#34; id=&#34;range&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#range&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tides can also be classified by range, which is the difference in height between the high and low tides. The three main types of tidal ranges are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Microtidal tides:&lt;/strong&gt; A range of less than 2 meters.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mesotidal tides:&lt;/strong&gt; A range of 2 to 4 meters.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Macrotidal tides:&lt;/strong&gt; A range of more than 4 meters.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Type&lt;span class=&#34;hx-absolute -hx-mt-20&#34; id=&#34;type&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#type&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tides can also be classified by type, based on the forces that cause them. The three main types of tides are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Astronomical tides:&lt;/strong&gt; Caused by the gravitational pull of the moon and the sun.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meteorological tides:&lt;/strong&gt; Caused by atmospheric pressure changes and winds.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Seiches:&lt;/strong&gt; Caused by the resonant oscillation of water in enclosed or semi-enclosed bodies of water, such as lakes and bays.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Examples&lt;span class=&#34;hx-absolute -hx-mt-20&#34; id=&#34;examples&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#examples&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here are some examples of different types of tides:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Diurnal tides:&lt;/strong&gt; Diurnal tides are common in the tropics, where the moon passes overhead twice a day.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Semi-diurnal tides:&lt;/strong&gt; Semi-diurnal tides are common in temperate and polar regions, where the moon passes overhead once a day.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mixed tides:&lt;/strong&gt; Mixed tides are found in many coastal areas, where the shape of the coastline and the ocean basin can affect the frequency of the tides.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Microtidal tides:&lt;/strong&gt; Microtidal tides are found along most of the coast of California.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mesotidal tides:&lt;/strong&gt; Mesotidal tides are found along most of the coast of the United States, as well as along the coasts of Europe and Asia.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Macrotidal tides:&lt;/strong&gt; Macrotidal tides are found along the coast of Canada, the Bay of Fundy, and the coast of Patagonia.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Astronomical tides:&lt;/strong&gt; Astronomical tides are the most common type of tide. They are caused by the gravitational pull of the moon and the sun.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meteorological tides:&lt;/strong&gt; Meteorological tides are less common than astronomical tides. They are caused by atmospheric pressure changes and winds.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Seiches:&lt;/strong&gt; Seiches are rare, but they can occur in enclosed or semi-enclosed bodies of water, such as lakes and bays.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tides are a complex phenomenon that is influenced by a variety of factors. However, the classification of tides by frequency, range, and type can help us to better understand and predict the tides.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Here is a summary of the main places of origin, trade routes, and seasonal variations of important cargoes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;thead&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;th&gt;Cargo&lt;/th&gt;
          &lt;th&gt;Main places of origin&lt;/th&gt;
          &lt;th&gt;Trade routes&lt;/th&gt;
          &lt;th&gt;Seasonal variations&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/thead&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;Crude oil&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;Middle East, Russia, United States, Canada, Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Iran, Kuwait, Venezuela,   Nigeria&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;Asia, Europe, North America, South America&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;Demand for crude oil is relatively constant throughout the year, but there can be fluctuations due to factors such as economic growth, weather events, and geopolitical tensions.&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;Iron ore&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;Australia, Brazil, China, India, Russia	China, Japan, South Korea, Europe&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;Demand for iron ore is seasonal, with higher demand in the second half of the year as steel mills prepare for the winter construction season.&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;Coal&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;Australia, Indonesia, Russia, United States, China&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;China, Japan, South Korea, India, Europe&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;Demand for coal is seasonal, with higher demand in the winter months for heating and power generation.&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;Grain&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;United States, Argentina, Brazil, Russia, Ukraine, Canada, Australia&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;China, Japan, South Korea, Europe, Middle East, Africa&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;Demand for grain is relatively constant throughout the year, but there can be fluctuations due to factors such as weather events and crop yields.&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;Fertilizer&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;China, Russia, United States, Canada, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Morocco&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;India, Brazil, Indonesia, United States, China&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;Demand for fertilizer is seasonal, with higher demand in the spring and fall planting seasons.&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;Other important cargoes&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Containerized cargo:&lt;span class=&#34;hx-absolute -hx-mt-20&#34; id=&#34;containerized-cargo&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#containerized-cargo&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This includes a wide variety of goods, such as manufactured goods, electronics, and clothing. Containerized cargo is typically shipped on container ships, which have fixed routes and schedules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Breakbulk cargo:&lt;span class=&#34;hx-absolute -hx-mt-20&#34; id=&#34;breakbulk-cargo&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#breakbulk-cargo&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This includes goods that are too large or heavy to be shipped in containers, such as vehicles, machinery, and wind turbine blades. Breakbulk cargo is typically shipped on breakbulk ships, which have flexible routes and schedules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Ro/Ro cargo:&lt;span class=&#34;hx-absolute -hx-mt-20&#34; id=&#34;roro-cargo&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#roro-cargo&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This includes vehicles and other wheeled cargo that can be rolled on and off of ships. Ro/Ro cargo is typically shipped on ro/ro ships, which have special ramps and decks to accommodate this type of cargo.
Seasonal variations&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to the seasonal variations in demand for certain cargoes, there can also be seasonal variations in trade routes. For example, during the winter months, some shipping routes in the Arctic and Antarctic may be closed due to ice. Additionally, some ports may be closed during certain times of the year due to weather events or other factors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is important to note that the information above is general in nature. The specific places of origin, trade routes, and seasonal variations of important cargoes can vary depending on a number of factors, such as global economic conditions, geopolitical tensions, and weather events&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;h2&gt;Diving Deeper into Addbacks in Marine Insurance: A Comprehensive Exploration&lt;span class=&#34;hx-absolute -hx-mt-20&#34; id=&#34;diving-deeper-into-addbacks-in-marine-insurance-a-comprehensive-exploration&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#diving-deeper-into-addbacks-in-marine-insurance-a-comprehensive-exploration&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;My previous response provided a basic overview of addbacks in average adjusting for marine insurance. Let&amp;rsquo;s now take a deeper dive into this intricate concept, exploring its nuances and implications in greater detail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Beyond the Basics:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Types of Addbacks:&lt;/strong&gt; We discussed several common examples like salvage charges and special charges. However, the list of potential addbacks extends further. Specific examples can include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Port charges incurred due to a general average incident:&lt;/strong&gt; If entering a specific port becomes necessary for repairs or salvaging operations related to the average sacrifice.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wages and provisions for crew during detention:&lt;/strong&gt; Crew expenses incurred while the ship is detained following a general average incident, waiting for repairs or further instructions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Damage to the sacrificing vessel beyond the general average:&lt;/strong&gt; If the vessel that made the sacrifice sustains additional damage not directly related to the common safety, those costs might be considered an addback.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Determining Eligibility:&lt;/strong&gt; Not all expenses automatically qualify as addbacks. They must meet specific criteria to be considered distinct from the general average sacrifice:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Direct benefit to a specific interest:&lt;/strong&gt; The expense must primarily benefit a particular party&amp;rsquo;s property, not the common safety of the entire voyage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No causal connection to the general average:&lt;/strong&gt; The expense wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have occurred had the general average situation not arisen, but it must not be a direct consequence of the chosen sacrifice itself.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reasonable and necessary:&lt;/strong&gt; The expense incurred must be deemed reasonable and necessary under the circumstances.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Impact on Average Adjusting:&lt;/strong&gt; Addbacks play a crucial role in the average adjusting process, influencing various aspects:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Calculation of General Average Contribution:&lt;/strong&gt; By excluding addbacks from the total claims, the general average contribution for each party is reduced, making it fairer for those incurring specific expenses.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Motivation for Prompt Action:&lt;/strong&gt; Knowing that certain expenses will be reimbursed encourages parties to take swift action during emergencies, potentially minimizing overall losses.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Transparency and Fairness:&lt;/strong&gt; Clearly defined rules for addbacks enhance the transparency and fairness of the average adjusting process, minimizing disputes and misunderstandings.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Legal and Policy Considerations:&lt;/strong&gt; The intricacies of addbacks are often outlined in marine insurance policies and relevant maritime laws. Consulting with:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Average adjusters:&lt;/strong&gt; These professionals possess specialized expertise in navigating the complexities of average adjusting and addbacks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Maritime lawyers:&lt;/strong&gt; Lawyers with expertise in maritime law can provide legal guidance regarding specific addback claims and potential disputes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, addbacks are not just a simple accounting exercise but a crucial element ensuring fairness and efficiency in marine insurance. Understanding their nuances and legal implications empowers various stakeholders to navigate challenging situations with greater clarity and confidence. I hope this expanded explanation sheds further light on this fascinating aspect of marine insurance. Feel free to ask if you have any further questions or want to explore specific aspects in even greater detail.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Sue And Labour Clause&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ‘sue and labour’ clause in the SG form of policy reads: ‘and in case of any loss or misfortune it shall be lawful to the assured, their factors, servants and assigns, to sue, labour, and travel for, in and about the defence, safeguards, and recovery of the said goods and merchandises, and ship, etc., or any part thereof, without prejudice to this insurance; to the charges whereof we, the assurers, will contribute…’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The modern counterpart of this clause may be found, for example, in clause 11 of the Institute Time Clauses – Hulls (1/11/95):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘11.1 In case of any loss or misfortune it is the duty of the Assured and their servants and agents to take such measures as may be reasonable for the purpose of averting or minimising a loss which would be recoverable under this insurance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;11.2…the Underwriters will contribute to charges properly and reasonably incurred by the Assured their servants or agents for such measures…’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This formulation is also retained in clause 9 of the International Hull Clauses 2003. See also clause 16 of the Institute Cargo Clauses (A) (1/1/82) or (1/1/09) (often referred to as the ‘Bailee Clause’), because it imposes a wider duty than clause 11 of the Hulls Clauses in that it requires the assured to preserve rights of action against third parties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A sue and labour clause probably has two components, namely:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a) A duty upon the assured to take reasonable steps to avert or minimise a loss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;b) An obligation upon the insurer to indemnify the assured for the costs of such steps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The former component is unnecessary given that the duty is set out in section 78(4) MIA. The latter component, however, seems to be essential to the recovery of a ‘sue and labour’ expense by the assured from the insurer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;2&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Assured’s Entitlement Under The Sue And Labour Clause&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under section 78(1)MIA, where a policy contains a sue and labour clause, ‘the engagement thereby entered into is deemed to be supplementary to the contract of insurance, and the assured may recover from the insurer any expenses properly incurred pursuant to the clause…’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, if the policy contains such a clause, the assured is entitled to recover from the insurer the expenses incurred pursuant to the clause (i.e. the expenses incurred for the purpose of minimising or averting a loss (provided that they are reasonably and properly incurred)).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The insurer’s liability is supplementary to his or her liability under the insurance contract (i.e. the insurer will be liable for such expenses in addition to the limit of his or her liability under the insurance contract).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a) If the insurance contract limits the insurer’s liability (by way of a valuation or a ‘sum insured’ clause) to say US$2,000,000, any sue and labour expenses are recoverable notwithstanding that the insurer is also liable for the US$2,000,000 under the insurance&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;b) Similarly, sue and labour expenses may be incurred even though a policy limit has been reached, subject to the terms of the contract.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;c) It does not matter if the subject-matter of the insurance is warranted free from particular average (sections 76(2), 78(1) MIA or the insurer has paid a total loss (section 78(1) MIA). When does a right to recover ‘sue and labour’ expenses from the insurer arise (assuming the insurance contract contains a ‘sue and labour’ clause)? It appears that the following elements have to be proved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;d) An insured peril was imminent or was operative. As to the meaning of an ‘imminent’ peril in the context of a clause similar to a sue and labour clause in a ‘construction all risks’ policy, the authority is the case of Gerling General Insurance Co v Canary Wharf Group plc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;e) The assured or his or her agent has undertaken unusual and extraordinary steps or exertion or incurred unusual and extraordinary expense. The expense need not necessarily involve the outlay of money; a waiver of a claim which has a value in money will be sufficient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;f) The purpose of the action or the expense must have been to preserve the insured property from loss by an insured peril. If the expense was incurred for the purpose of averting or minimizing a loss not covered by the policy, the expense is not recoverable under the sue and labour clause (section 78(3) MIA). (Where the expense is incurred for dual purposes, one of which is to prevent or minimise a loss covered by the policy.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;g) The action or expense must have been reasonable. It does not have to be successful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;h) If a loss had occurred by reason of the insured peril, the loss would have been indemnifiable under the insurance contract. It is not necessary for the assured to show that the loss would very probably have occurred; there need only be a risk that the insurer would have to bear the loss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the purpose of the expense is to avoid a loss which is covered under the policy and a loss which is not covered under the policy, the assured will be entitled to recover a proportionate part of the expense (Cunard Steamship Co v Marten, Kuwait Airways Corp v Kuwait Insurance Co SAK; compare the position where the expense is incurred to protect insured property and lives not insured under the policy: Royal Boskalis Westminster NV v Mountain).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As to the recovery of ransoms paid to pirates under a sue and labour clause, see Masefield AG v Amlin Corporate Member Ltd.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, if the expense has been incurred illegally, then the expense may not be recovered from the insurer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As to the recovery of mitigation expenses where there was a dual purpose behind such expenditure, in the case of non-marine insurance, see Ace European Group Ltd v Standard Life Assurance Ltd.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As to the position where the expense is incurred to protect both insured property and lives not insured under the policy, see also Atlasnavios-Navegação Lda v Navigators Insurance Co Ltd.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Costs may be recovered under the sue and labour clause of a marine policy even where such costs would not be recovered as partial loss or particular average claims under the same policy: Atlasnavios-Navegação Lda v Navigators Insurance Co Ltd.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It may be that sue and labour costs may also constitute ‘cost of repair’ for the purpose of determining whether the insured vessel is a constructive total loss: Connect Shipping Inc v The Swedish Club (The Renos).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a loss had occurred by reason of the insured peril, the loss must have been indemnifiable under the insurance contract. As to the degree of possibility or probability of such loss occurring, see Integrated Container Service Inc v British Traders Insurance Co Ltd; see also Suez Fortune Investments Ltd v Talbot Underwriting Ltd.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sue and labour expenses may be incurred while the insured peril continues to operate, in other words until the vessel is in a place of safety (Suez Fortune Investments Ltd v Talbot Underwriting Ltd).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The entitlement to recover sue and labour expenses appears to come to an end upon the issue of legal proceedings in respect of the relevant loss (Kuwait Airways Corp v Kuwait Insurance Co SAK; Atlasnavios-Navegação Lda v Navigators Insurance Co Ltd; Suez Fortune Investments Ltd v Talbot Underwriting Ltd.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;3&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Assured’s Entitlement In The Absence Of A Sue And Labour Clause&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If there is no sue and labour clause, the question arises whether or not the assured can recover expenses incurred for the purpose of preserving or protecting the subject-matter insured from loss caused by an insured peril in any event or on any other grounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Courts are generally sceptical towards any attempt to recover mitigation expenses in the absence of a sue and labour clause (Seele Austria GmbH &amp;amp; Co v Tokio Marine Europe Insurance Ltd).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, there are five possible bases upon which there might be such a recovery:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a) If the expense can be viewed as a loss resulting from the operation of the insured peril, the expense may be recovered under the policy, unless there is a break in the chain of causation (see Stanley v Western Insurance Co, The Diamond, Symington &amp;amp; Co v Union Insurance Society of Canton Ltd, Canada Rice Mills Ltd v Union Marine &amp;amp; General Insurance Co Ltd, compare Kuwait Airways Corp v Kuwait Insurance Co SAK). If the assured mistakenly believes that there is an imminent or operative peril, the assured will not be able to recover an indemnity for any expenses incurred thereby (Joseph Watson &amp;amp; Son Ltd v Firemen’s Fund Insurance Co of San Francisco).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;b) The expense may be recovered as ‘salvage charges’ within the meaning of section 65 MIA. Under that section, salvage charges are charges recoverable by a salvor under ‘maritime law’ independently of a contract and do not include charges incurred under a salvage contract, which are normally recoverable under the sue and labour clause (clause 10 of the Institute Time Clauses – Hulls (1/11/95), clause 10; International Hull Clauses 2003, clause 8).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;c) The expense may be recovered as a ‘general average loss’ pursuant to section 66(4) MIA. This depends on establishing a ‘general average act’ within the meaning of section 66(2) MIA (The Abt Rasha) (see clause 10 of the Institute Time Clauses – Hulls (1/11/95), clause 10; International Hull Clauses 2003, clause 8).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;d) If the expense is incurred as ‘particular charges’, which are defined under section 64(2) of the MIA as ‘expenses incurred by or on behalf of the assured for the safety or preservation of the subject-matter insured, other than general average and salvage charges’. The traditional view is that particular charges are not recoverable in the absence of a sue and labour However, where the view is set out that particular charges may be recovered independently of a sue and labour clause provided that ‘it can plausibly be said that the need for the expenditure is the direct and natural result of the casualty and the MIA does not lay down a specific measure of indemnity which meets the case’. This view was referred to with apparent approval in the case of Royal Boskalis Westminster NV v Mountain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;e) There is an argument that such expenses may be recovered as ‘mitigation damages’ or pursuant to an implied term. However, this is contrary to the decision of the Court of Appeal in Yorkshire Water v Sun Alliance &amp;amp; London Insurance Ltd. As regards the Bailee Clause, in The Netherlands Insurance Co Est 1845 Ltd v Karl Ljungberg &amp;amp; Co AB, the Privy Council found that there was an implied term entitling the assured to be reimbursed in respect of the second limb of the Bailee Clause (however, in this case, there was also a sue and labour clause).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;4&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Assured’s Duty To Mitigate: S.78(4)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Section 78(4) MIA provides that ‘it is the duty of the assured and his agents, in all cases, to take such measures as may be reasonable for the purpose of averting or minimising a loss.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following attributes of section 78(4) MIA should be noted:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a) Although section 78(4) MIA speaks of a ‘duty’, this is in effect no more than a statement of the law that if the assured or his agents fail to take reasonable measures to avert or minimise a loss, that failure may be the proximate cause of the assured’s loss, in whole or in part, so that the assured would be unable to prove that that part of the loss is caused by an insured peril and would be prevented from recovering an indemnity in respect of such loss under the policy. It is comparable to the ‘duty to mitigate’ arising in respect of ordinary The failure to comply with this duty will not automatically constitute a defence to the claim (compare Currie &amp;amp; Co v The Bombay Native Insurance Co) or give rise to a claim for damages for breach of contract (The Gold Sky), unless the relevant duty can be said to arise by way of an express or implied promissory obligation (The Vasso– this case involved the ‘Bailee Clause’).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;b) The word ‘agents’ is a reference to ‘agents to sue and labour’, that is, agents who have been instructed by the assured to take steps to preserve or protect the property insured and/or who are agents by Such agents generally will include the master (Currie &amp;amp; Co v The Bombay Native Insurance Co, State of the Netherlands v Youell, contra The Gold Sky).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;c) The duty is one of reasonableness. The assured must act as a prudent uninsured (Integrated Container Service Inc v British Traders Insurance Co Ltd), taking into account the knowledge and experience of the assured or his or her agent (Stephen v Scottish Boatowners Mutual Insurance Association (The Talisman).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;d) There is a potential conflict between sections 55(2)(a) and 78(4) MIA in that the former provision provides that unreasonable conduct on the part of the master will not prevent the assured from recovering under the policy provided that the loss has been caused by an insured peril, whereas the latter provision provides that the assured’s claim may be prejudiced if the master as the assured’s agent fails to take reasonable steps to avert or minimise the damage. In State of the Netherlands v Youell, the Court of Appeal said that this conflict is unlikely to arise and noted that if the master’s negligence is an insured peril under the policy, the conflict would not arise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;e) The duty applies ‘in all cases’, suggesting that it applies even when there is no sue and labour&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;f) However, there is a question whether or not the duty applies in respect of all circumstances which are insured or only those relating to a maritime adventure (section 3 MIA).&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>13. Terrestrial and ship&#39;s magnetism :</title>

      <description>
        
        
        &lt;p&gt;Excellent topic. This is a fundamental and critical area of knowledge for any mariner, as it directly relates to the use and accuracy of the magnetic compass for navigation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is a comprehensive breakdown of Terrestrial and Ship&amp;rsquo;s Magnetism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Overview&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;hx-absolute -hx-mt-20&#34; id=&#34;overview&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#overview&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;For safe navigation, a mariner needs to know their direction relative to &lt;strong&gt;True North&lt;/strong&gt; (the direction of the geographic North Pole). A magnetic compass, however, does not point to True North. It is influenced by two primary magnetic fields:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Terrestrial Magnetism:&lt;/strong&gt; The Earth&amp;rsquo;s own magnetic field.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ship&amp;rsquo;s Magnetism:&lt;/strong&gt; The magnetic field created by the ship itself.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding and correcting for the effects of both is essential for accurate navigation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Part 1: Terrestrial Magnetism (The Earth&amp;rsquo;s Magnetism)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;hx-absolute -hx-mt-20&#34; id=&#34;part-1-terrestrial-magnetism-the-earth&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#part-1-terrestrial-magnetism-the-earth&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Earth behaves like a giant, imperfect magnet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. The Source&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;hx-absolute -hx-mt-20&#34; id=&#34;1-the-source&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#1-the-source&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Earth&amp;rsquo;s magnetic field is believed to be generated by the &lt;strong&gt;dynamo effect&lt;/strong&gt; in its molten outer core. The movement of liquid iron, driven by convection and the Earth&amp;rsquo;s rotation, creates electrical currents, which in turn produce the magnetic field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Key Characteristics&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;hx-absolute -hx-mt-20&#34; id=&#34;2-key-characteristics&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#2-key-characteristics&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Magnetic Poles:&lt;/strong&gt; The Earth has a North Magnetic Pole and a South Magnetic Pole. Crucially, &lt;strong&gt;these are not in the same location as the geographic poles&lt;/strong&gt;. Furthermore, they wander over time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Magnetic Field Lines:&lt;/strong&gt; Lines of magnetic force flow from the South Magnetic Pole, around the Earth&amp;rsquo;s surface, and into the North Magnetic Pole. A compass needle aligns itself with these lines of force.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Horizontal and Vertical Components:&lt;/strong&gt; At any point on Earth, the magnetic field can be broken down into two components:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Horizontal Force (H):&lt;/strong&gt; This is the component that directs the compass needle to point north-south. It is strongest at the magnetic equator and weakest near the magnetic poles.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vertical Force (Z) / Magnetic Dip:&lt;/strong&gt; This is the component that pulls the compass needle downwards (in the Northern Hemisphere) or upwards (in the Southern Hemisphere). This angle of &amp;ldquo;dip&amp;rdquo; is 0° at the magnetic equator and 90° at the magnetic poles. This force doesn&amp;rsquo;t help with direction but can cause the compass card to tilt.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. The Navigational Error: Variation (or Declination)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;hx-absolute -hx-mt-20&#34; id=&#34;3-the-navigational-error-variation-or-declination&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#3-the-navigational-error-variation-or-declination&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because the magnetic and geographic poles are in different locations, a magnetic compass will not point to True North.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Variation&lt;/strong&gt; is the angle between the direction of &lt;strong&gt;True North&lt;/strong&gt; and the direction of &lt;strong&gt;Magnetic North&lt;/strong&gt; at a specific location on Earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is named &lt;strong&gt;East&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;West&lt;/strong&gt; depending on whether Magnetic North is to the east or west of True North.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Variation changes with geographic location and also changes slowly over time (secular change).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The value of variation for any given area is printed on nautical charts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>14. Compass construction and siting :</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/docs/partb/adnav/mag/prompt_47/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>
        
        
        &lt;p&gt;Of course. This topic covers the physical makeup of a compass and the practical skill of using it to find directions to objects in the field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is a detailed breakdown of compass construction and siting (often called &amp;ldquo;sighting&amp;rdquo;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Part 1: Compass Construction&lt;span class=&#34;hx-absolute -hx-mt-20&#34; id=&#34;part-1-compass-construction&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#part-1-compass-construction&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;A compass is a navigational instrument that shows direction relative to the Earth&amp;rsquo;s magnetic poles. While there are many types (lensatic, thumb, digital), the most common for hiking and general use is the &lt;strong&gt;baseplate or orienteering compass&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Key Components of a Baseplate Compass:&lt;span class=&#34;hx-absolute -hx-mt-20&#34; id=&#34;key-components-of-a-baseplate-compass&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#key-components-of-a-baseplate-compass&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Baseplate:&lt;/strong&gt; The clear, flat plastic base the compass is mounted on. It has rulers (in inches, cm, and map scales) along the edges for measuring distances on a map.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Direction-of-Travel Arrow:&lt;/strong&gt; A large arrow printed on the baseplate that you point at your destination. This is the most important arrow for taking and following a bearing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Housing (or Bezel):&lt;/strong&gt; The rotating circular part of the compass that is marked with 360 degrees (the cardinal points N, S, E, W are also marked). This is what you turn to set or read a bearing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Magnetic Needle:&lt;/strong&gt; The heart of the compass. It&amp;rsquo;s a lightweight, magnetized piece of metal that pivots freely. The &lt;strong&gt;red end&lt;/strong&gt; always points towards the Earth&amp;rsquo;s magnetic north pole. It is often housed in a liquid-filled capsule to dampen its movement and allow it to settle quickly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Orienting Arrow (The &amp;ldquo;Shed&amp;rdquo;):&lt;/strong&gt; An arrow marked on the floor of the housing. Its job is to be aligned with the magnetic needle. A common way to remember this is the phrase &lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;put red in the shed&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;—meaning, turn the housing until the red magnetic needle is inside the outline of the orienting arrow.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Index Line:&lt;/strong&gt; A small line on the edge of the housing where you read the bearing in degrees. It is located at the top of the baseplate, directly in line with the Direction-of-Travel Arrow.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Declination Scale:&lt;/strong&gt; A smaller scale inside the housing used to adjust for the difference between Magnetic North (where the needle points) and True North (the geographic North Pole on a map).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

      <title>15. Compass adjustment:</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/docs/partb/adnav/mag/prompt_50/</link>

      <description>
        
        
        &lt;p&gt;Excellent topic. &amp;ldquo;Compass adjustment&amp;rdquo; is a critical procedure in maritime and aviation navigation for ensuring the accuracy of a magnetic compass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is a comprehensive explanation of compass adjustment, covering the what, why, and how.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Compass Adjustment&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;hx-absolute -hx-mt-20&#34; id=&#34;compass-adjustment&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#compass-adjustment&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. What is Compass Adjustment?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compass adjustment is the process of correcting for &lt;strong&gt;deviation&lt;/strong&gt;—the magnetic error caused by the ship or aircraft itself. The goal is not to eliminate deviation completely (which is often impossible) but to reduce it to a minimum and then create a table of the remaining errors so they can be accounted for in navigation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This process is often called &lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;swinging the compass&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;swinging the ship.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Why is it Necessary? The Two Magnetic Errors&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A magnetic compass points to Magnetic North, not True North. To navigate accurately, a user must account for two distinct errors:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Variation (or Declination):&lt;/strong&gt; This is the angle between True North (the geographic North Pole) and Magnetic North. It is a natural, geographic error that varies depending on your location on Earth. Variation is found on nautical or aeronautical charts and is applied as a known correction. &lt;strong&gt;You cannot adjust the compass for variation.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Deviation:&lt;/strong&gt; This is the error caused by the magnetic fields of the vessel or aircraft itself. Large metal components (the hull, engine), electrical equipment, and even cargo can create their own magnetic fields that &amp;ldquo;pull&amp;rdquo; the compass needle away from Magnetic North. This error changes as the vessel changes its heading. &lt;strong&gt;This is the error that compass adjustment corrects.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In short:&lt;/strong&gt; Variation is the Earth&amp;rsquo;s error. Deviation is the ship&amp;rsquo;s error. Compass adjustment deals with the ship&amp;rsquo;s error.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. The Process: Swinging the Compass&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The adjustment is performed by a licensed Compass Adjuster. The general procedure is as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Preparation:&lt;/strong&gt; All equipment that might affect the compass (engines, generators, radar) should be running as it would be during normal operation. Any large magnetic objects near the compass should be in their usual seagoing positions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Swinging:&lt;/strong&gt; The vessel is slowly turned through a full 360 degrees.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Observation:&lt;/strong&gt; At various headings (usually every 15 or 30 degrees), the compass reading is compared to the known correct magnetic heading. This &amp;ldquo;known&amp;rdquo; heading can be determined by:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Leading Marks (Transits):&lt;/strong&gt; Aligning two fixed objects on shore whose magnetic bearing is known from a chart.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gyrocompass:&lt;/strong&gt; Comparing the magnetic compass to a gyrocompass (which points to True North and is unaffected by magnetism).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Celestial Bearings:&lt;/strong&gt; Taking a bearing of the sun or another celestial body at a specific time and calculating its true bearing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Adjustment:&lt;/strong&gt; Based on the observed errors (the deviation), the adjuster uses various correctors built into the compass binnacle to counteract the ship&amp;rsquo;s magnetic fields.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. The Tools: The Correctors&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The standard compass binnacle is equipped with several correctors to counteract the different components of the ship&amp;rsquo;s magnetism:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fore-and-Aft Magnets:&lt;/strong&gt; Small permanent magnets placed in a holder running parallel to the ship&amp;rsquo;s centerline. They correct for permanent magnetism in the athwartships (port-starboard) direction.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Athwartships Magnets:&lt;/strong&gt; Permanent magnets placed perpendicular to the ship&amp;rsquo;s centerline. They correct for permanent magnetism in the fore-and-aft direction.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quadrantal Spheres (Kelvin&amp;rsquo;s Balls):&lt;/strong&gt; Two soft iron spheres mounted on either side of the compass. They correct for magnetism induced in the ship&amp;rsquo;s horizontal soft iron, which causes errors on the quadrantal headings (NE, SE, SW, NW).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Flinders Bar:&lt;/strong&gt; A vertical bar of soft iron placed in a case on the fore or aft side of the binnacle. It corrects for magnetism induced in the ship&amp;rsquo;s vertical soft iron.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Heeling Magnet:&lt;/strong&gt; A vertical magnet placed directly underneath the compass card pivot. It corrects for errors that occur when the ship is heeling (rolling).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. The Result: The Deviation Card&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the adjuster has minimized the deviation using the correctors, the small remaining errors are recorded on a &lt;strong&gt;Deviation Card&lt;/strong&gt; (or Deviation Table). This card is posted near the helm for the navigator to use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A typical deviation card looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;thead&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;th style=&#34;text-align: left&#34;&gt;Ship&amp;rsquo;s Head (Compass)&lt;/th&gt;
          &lt;th style=&#34;text-align: left&#34;&gt;Deviation&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/thead&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;td style=&#34;text-align: left&#34;&gt;000°&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td style=&#34;text-align: left&#34;&gt;2° E&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;td style=&#34;text-align: left&#34;&gt;015°&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td style=&#34;text-align: left&#34;&gt;1° E&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;td style=&#34;text-align: left&#34;&gt;030°&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td style=&#34;text-align: left&#34;&gt;0°&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;td style=&#34;text-align: left&#34;&gt;045°&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td style=&#34;text-align: left&#34;&gt;1° W&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;td style=&#34;text-align: left&#34;&gt;&amp;hellip; (and so on)&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td style=&#34;text-align: left&#34;&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
          &lt;td style=&#34;text-align: left&#34;&gt;345°&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;td style=&#34;text-align: left&#34;&gt;1° E&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The navigator uses this card to find the deviation for their current heading and apply it to their calculations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6. Practical Application: The TVMDC Rule&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To convert a True course (from a chart) to a Compass course (to steer), or vice versa, navigators use a simple mnemonic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;T&lt;/strong&gt;rue &lt;strong&gt;V&lt;/strong&gt;irgins &lt;strong&gt;M&lt;/strong&gt;ake &lt;strong&gt;D&lt;/strong&gt;ull &lt;strong&gt;C&lt;/strong&gt;ompany
(True - Variation - Magnetic - Deviation - Compass)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correcting (Compass to True):&lt;/strong&gt; When you go &amp;ldquo;up&amp;rdquo; the list from Compass to True, you &lt;strong&gt;ADD&lt;/strong&gt; Easterly errors and &lt;strong&gt;SUBTRACT&lt;/strong&gt; Westerly errors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mnemonic: &lt;strong&gt;C&lt;/strong&gt;an &lt;strong&gt;D&lt;/strong&gt;ead &lt;strong&gt;M&lt;/strong&gt;en &lt;strong&gt;V&lt;/strong&gt;ote &lt;strong&gt;T&lt;/strong&gt;wice?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Un-correcting (True to Compass):&lt;/strong&gt; When you go &amp;ldquo;down&amp;rdquo; the list from True to Compass, you &lt;strong&gt;SUBTRACT&lt;/strong&gt; Easterly errors and &lt;strong&gt;ADD&lt;/strong&gt; Westerly errors. (The opposite of above).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A common rhyme for this direction: &amp;ldquo;Error East, Compass Least. Error West, Compass Best.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Example:&lt;/strong&gt;
A ship wants to steer a &lt;strong&gt;True&lt;/strong&gt; course of &lt;strong&gt;085°&lt;/strong&gt;.
Variation from the chart is &lt;strong&gt;10° W&lt;/strong&gt;.
Deviation from the card for that heading is &lt;strong&gt;3° E&lt;/strong&gt;.
What is the Compass course to steer?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;T&lt;/strong&gt;rue: 085°&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;V&lt;/strong&gt;ariation: 10° W  (West is Added when going down)
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;085° + 10° = 095°&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;M&lt;/strong&gt;agnetic: 095°&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;D&lt;/strong&gt;eviation: 3° E (East is Subtracted when going down)
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;095° - 3° = 092°&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;C&lt;/strong&gt;ompass: &lt;strong&gt;092°&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The helmsman must steer &lt;strong&gt;092°&lt;/strong&gt; by the ship&amp;rsquo;s compass to travel along a true course of 085°.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>
        
        
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SOLAS 90+50&lt;/strong&gt; is a term often used to collectively refer to the &lt;strong&gt;SOLAS 90&lt;/strong&gt; damage stability standards and the &lt;strong&gt;Stockholm Agreement&lt;/strong&gt;, as well as the subsequent &lt;strong&gt;SOLAS 2009&lt;/strong&gt; regulations, which introduced a probabilistic approach to ship safety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Key Points:&lt;span class=&#34;hx-absolute -hx-mt-20&#34; id=&#34;key-points&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#key-points&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SOLAS 90:&lt;/strong&gt; Established deterministic damage stability requirements for ships, particularly focusing on passenger ferries.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stockholm Agreement:&lt;/strong&gt; Introduced additional, stricter stability standards for ro-ro passenger ships operating in specific sea areas, particularly in response to the MS Estonia tragedy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SOLAS 2009:&lt;/strong&gt; Marked a significant shift from deterministic to probabilistic methods for assessing ship safety. This involved using statistical models to evaluate the likelihood of various damage scenarios and their consequences.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why the Shift to Probabilistic Approach?&lt;span class=&#34;hx-absolute -hx-mt-20&#34; id=&#34;why-the-shift-to-probabilistic-approach&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#why-the-shift-to-probabilistic-approach&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The probabilistic approach offers several advantages:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More Realistic Assessment:&lt;/strong&gt; It considers a wider range of potential damage scenarios, providing a more accurate picture of ship safety.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Improved Risk Management:&lt;/strong&gt; By quantifying risks, it allows for better decision-making in ship design and operation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enhanced Safety:&lt;/strong&gt; Ultimately, it aims to improve the overall safety of ships and passengers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Challenges and Considerations:&lt;span class=&#34;hx-absolute -hx-mt-20&#34; id=&#34;challenges-and-considerations&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#challenges-and-considerations&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Complexity:&lt;/strong&gt; Probabilistic methods require sophisticated calculations and modeling, which can be complex and resource-intensive.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Data Availability:&lt;/strong&gt; Accurate data on damage scenarios and their consequences is essential for reliable probabilistic assessments.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Industry Adoption:&lt;/strong&gt; The transition from deterministic to probabilistic methods requires a significant learning curve for the maritime industry.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite these challenges, the move towards probabilistic safety assessment is a crucial step in enhancing maritime safety.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Accountancy Ratios</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/docs/parta/marecofin/acc_ratios/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/docs/parta/marecofin/acc_ratios/</guid>
      <description>
        
        
        &lt;p&gt;Here are short notes and formulas for &lt;strong&gt;major accountancy ratios&lt;/strong&gt;, categorized by type:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Profitability Ratios&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;hx-absolute -hx-mt-20&#34; id=&#34;1-profitability-ratios&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#1-profitability-ratios&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measure a company’s ability to generate profit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gross Profit Margin&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
$$
  \text{Gross Profit Margin} = \left( \frac{\text{Gross Profit}}{\text{Revenue}} \right) \times 100
  $$&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Indicates profit after direct costs (COGS).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Net Profit Margin&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
$$
  \text{Net Profit Margin} = \left( \frac{\text{Net Profit}}{\text{Revenue}} \right) \times 100
  $$&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Shows overall profitability after all expenses.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Return on Capital Employed (ROCE)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
$$
  \text{ROCE} = \left( \frac{\text{EBIT}}{\text{Capital Employed}} \right) \times 100
  $$&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Measures efficiency in using capital (Capital Employed = Equity + Debt).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Liquidity Ratios&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;hx-absolute -hx-mt-20&#34; id=&#34;2-liquidity-ratios&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#2-liquidity-ratios&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Assess short-term financial health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Current Ratio&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
$$
  \text{Current Ratio} = \frac{\text{Current Assets}}{\text{Current Liabilities}}
  $$&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Ideal: 2:1. Tests ability to cover short-term debts.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quick (Acid-Test) Ratio&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
$$
  \text{Quick Ratio} = \frac{\text{Current Assets} - \text{Inventory}}{\text{Current Liabilities}}
  $$&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Stricter measure (excludes inventory). Ideal: 1:1.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Efficiency Ratios&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;hx-absolute -hx-mt-20&#34; id=&#34;3-efficiency-ratios&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#3-efficiency-ratios&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Evaluate operational effectiveness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Inventory Turnover&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
$$
  \text{Inventory Turnover} = \frac{\text{Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)}}{\text{Average Inventory}}
  $$&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Higher = better inventory management.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Receivables Days&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
$$
  \text{Receivables Days} = \left( \frac{\text{Accounts Receivable}}{\text{Credit Sales}} \right) \times 365
  $$&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Measures how quickly customers pay.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Payables Days&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
$$
  \text{Payables Days} = \left( \frac{\text{Accounts Payable}}{\text{Credit Purchases}} \right) \times 365
  $$&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Shows how quickly a company pays suppliers.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Gearing (Leverage) Ratios&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;hx-absolute -hx-mt-20&#34; id=&#34;4-gearing-leverage-ratios&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#4-gearing-leverage-ratios&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measure financial risk and debt reliance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Debt-to-Equity Ratio&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
$$
  \text{Debt-to-Equity} = \frac{\text{Total Debt}}{\text{Total Equity}}
  $$&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;High ratio = higher financial risk.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Interest Cover&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
$$
  \text{Interest Cover} = \frac{\text{EBIT}}{\text{Interest Expense}}
  $$&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Ability to pay interest from profits (Ideal: &amp;gt;3x).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. Investment Ratios&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;hx-absolute -hx-mt-20&#34; id=&#34;5-investment-ratios&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#5-investment-ratios&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;For shareholder returns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Earnings Per Share (EPS)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
$$
  \text{EPS} = \frac{\text{Net Profit}}{\text{Number of Shares}}
  $$&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Price-to-Earnings (P/E) Ratio&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
$$
  \text{P/E} = \frac{\text{Market Price per Share}}{\text{EPS}}
  $$&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Higher P/E = growth expectations.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dividend Yield&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
$$
  \text{Dividend Yield} = \left( \frac{\text{Dividend per Share}}{\text{Market Price per Share}} \right) \times 100
  $$&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Notes:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;hx-absolute -hx-mt-20&#34; id=&#34;key-notes&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#key-notes&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Profitability&lt;/strong&gt; → Focus on margins and returns.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Liquidity&lt;/strong&gt; → Short-term solvency.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Efficiency&lt;/strong&gt; → Asset/utilization management.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gearing&lt;/strong&gt; → Debt vs. equity structure.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Investment&lt;/strong&gt; → Shareholder value metrics.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These ratios help analyze financial statements for decision-making. Adjust formulas based on context (e.g., using &lt;em&gt;EBITDA&lt;/em&gt; instead of &lt;em&gt;EBIT&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Would you like a deeper dive into any specific ratio?&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>
        
        
        &lt;h2&gt;What are Active Geological processes?&lt;span class=&#34;hx-absolute -hx-mt-20&#34; id=&#34;what-are-active-geological-processes&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#what-are-active-geological-processes&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Active geological processes are the forces that are constantly shaping and changing the Earth&amp;rsquo;s surface. These processes can be slow and gradual, like erosion, or they can be sudden and catastrophic, like volcanic eruptions and earthquakes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Here are some examples of active geological processes:&lt;span class=&#34;hx-absolute -hx-mt-20&#34; id=&#34;here-are-some-examples-of-active-geological-processes&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#here-are-some-examples-of-active-geological-processes&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Volcanoes&lt;span class=&#34;hx-absolute -hx-mt-20&#34; id=&#34;volcanoes&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#volcanoes&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Volcanoes are openings in the Earth&amp;rsquo;s crust that allow molten rock, ash, and gases to escape. When a volcano erupts, it can release a tremendous amount of energy, causing widespread destruction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Earthquakes&lt;span class=&#34;hx-absolute -hx-mt-20&#34; id=&#34;earthquakes&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#earthquakes&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earthquakes are caused by the sudden release of energy in the Earth&amp;rsquo;s crust. This energy can be released by the movement of tectonic plates, or by the eruption of a volcano. Earthquakes can cause widespread damage to buildings and infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Erosion&lt;span class=&#34;hx-absolute -hx-mt-20&#34; id=&#34;erosion&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#erosion&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Erosion is the process of wearing away and transporting rock and soil. It can be caused by wind, water, ice, and gravity. Erosion is a natural process that helps to shape the Earth&amp;rsquo;s surface, but it can also be a problem, especially in areas where it is accelerated by human activities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Glaciations&lt;span class=&#34;hx-absolute -hx-mt-20&#34; id=&#34;glaciations&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#glaciations&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Glaciations are periods of time when the Earth&amp;rsquo;s surface is covered in ice sheets and glaciers. Glaciations can last for millions of years, and they have a significant impact on the Earth&amp;rsquo;s climate and environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are just a few examples of the many active geological processes that are shaping the Earth today. These processes are essential for maintaining the planet&amp;rsquo;s habitability, but they can also pose a threat to human life and property. It is important to understand these processes and how to mitigate their risks.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Amortization of Drydock Expenses</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/docs/parta/marecofin/amortization-of-drydock/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/docs/parta/marecofin/amortization-of-drydock/</guid>
      <description>
        
        
        &lt;h2&gt;🧩 What is Drydocking?&lt;span class=&#34;hx-absolute -hx-mt-20&#34; id=&#34;-what-is-drydocking&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#-what-is-drydocking&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Drydocking&lt;/strong&gt; is the process of &lt;strong&gt;removing a ship from water&lt;/strong&gt; to perform &lt;strong&gt;maintenance, repairs, and inspections&lt;/strong&gt;. It’s a major expense that occurs &lt;strong&gt;every few years&lt;/strong&gt;, depending on the type of vessel and regulatory requirements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;🧠 Why is Drydocking Expense Amortized?&lt;span class=&#34;hx-absolute -hx-mt-20&#34; id=&#34;-why-is-drydocking-expense-amortized&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#-why-is-drydocking-expense-amortized&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3&gt;1. &lt;strong&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a Non-Recurring, Large Expense&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;hx-absolute -hx-mt-20&#34; id=&#34;1-it&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#1-it&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Drydocking is not an &lt;strong&gt;annual&lt;/strong&gt; expense — it happens every &lt;strong&gt;3–5 years&lt;/strong&gt;. If you were to &lt;strong&gt;record the full cost in one year&lt;/strong&gt;, it would distort the company&amp;rsquo;s &lt;strong&gt;profitability&lt;/strong&gt; for that year and make it hard to compare performance across periods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;2. &lt;strong&gt;Matching Principle (Accounting Concept)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;hx-absolute -hx-mt-20&#34; id=&#34;2-matching-principle-accounting-concept&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#2-matching-principle-accounting-concept&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under the &lt;strong&gt;accrual basis of accounting&lt;/strong&gt;, expenses should be &lt;strong&gt;matched with the revenues they help generate&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Drydocking improves the &lt;strong&gt;operational efficiency and safety&lt;/strong&gt; of the vessel.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The benefits of drydocking are spread over several years.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Therefore, the cost should be &lt;strong&gt;allocated over the period&lt;/strong&gt; during which the asset (the ship) continues to provide economic benefits.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;3. &lt;strong&gt;Amortization as a Method of Allocation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;hx-absolute -hx-mt-20&#34; id=&#34;3-amortization-as-a-method-of-allocation&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#3-amortization-as-a-method-of-allocation&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead of recognizing the full cost in one year, companies &lt;strong&gt;amortize&lt;/strong&gt; the drydocking expense over the &lt;strong&gt;number of years between drydockings&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If a ship undergoes drydocking every 4 years and the cost is $100,000,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Then each year, the company would record a &lt;strong&gt;$25,000 amortization expense&lt;/strong&gt; ($100,000 ÷ 4).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;📊 How is This Treated in Financial Statements?&lt;span class=&#34;hx-absolute -hx-mt-20&#34; id=&#34;-how-is-this-treated-in-financial-statements&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;li&gt;A &lt;strong&gt;yearly amortization expense&lt;/strong&gt; is recorded (e.g., $25,000 per year).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This avoids a huge dip in profits during the drydocking year.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;✅ In the &lt;strong&gt;Balance Sheet&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;span class=&#34;hx-absolute -hx-mt-20&#34; id=&#34;-in-the-balance-sheet&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;li&gt;The remaining unamortized portion of the drydocking cost is shown as a &lt;strong&gt;liability or an asset&lt;/strong&gt;, depending on how it&amp;rsquo;s treated.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If the expense has been paid in advance (i.e., cash was paid before the drydocking), it might be listed as a &lt;strong&gt;prepaid expense (asset)&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If the expense hasn&amp;rsquo;t been paid yet, it might be listed as a &lt;strong&gt;liability (provision or accrued expense)&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

          &lt;td&gt;$0&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Drydocking expenses are amortized&lt;/strong&gt; in the yearly financial statements to &lt;strong&gt;reflect the true cost of maintaining the vessel over its useful life&lt;/strong&gt;, rather than recognizing the entire expense in the year it occurs. This approach follows the &lt;strong&gt;matching principle&lt;/strong&gt; and ensures more accurate and consistent financial reporting.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>
        
        
        &lt;p&gt;The impact of cabotage on the development of Indian shipping and shipping in general around the Indian coast in the past 5 years has been a subject of significant debate and policy changes. Cabotage laws, which restrict foreign-flagged vessels from operating on domestic coastal routes, have historically aimed to protect and promote the Indian shipping industry. However, in recent years, there has been a gradual relaxation of these rules to boost coastal shipping, reduce logistics costs, and enhance trade.1
Here&amp;rsquo;s an analysis of the impact:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Positive Impacts of Cabotage Relaxation:&lt;span class=&#34;hx-absolute -hx-mt-20&#34; id=&#34;positive-impacts-of-cabotage-relaxation&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#positive-impacts-of-cabotage-relaxation&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Increased Competition and Reduced Costs:&lt;/strong&gt;
Allowing foreign-flagged vessels to operate on Indian coastal routes has increased competition, potentially driving down freight rates and reducing overall transportation costs for cargo owners.2 This is particularly beneficial for commodities like agriculture, horticulture, fisheries, and fertilizers, for which cabotage restrictions have been eased.3&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enhanced Coastal Shipping Volumes:&lt;/strong&gt;
The relaxation has led to an increase in the movement of certain types of cargo via coastal shipping, as foreign vessels can now participate without specific licenses.4 This aligns with the government&amp;rsquo;s aim to promote coastal shipping as a more cost-effective and environmentally friendly alternative to road and rail.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Improved Transhipment and Hub Development:&lt;/strong&gt; Easing cabotage for EXIM containers and empty containers has the potential to develop Indian ports into major transhipment hubs, reducing the reliance on ports like Colombo.5 This can lead to increased port traffic and revenue.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Attraction of Foreign Investment and Technology:&lt;/strong&gt; The entry of foreign shipping companies can bring in newer vessels, advanced technologies, and best practices, potentially modernizing the Indian shipping sector.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Boost to Specific Sectors:&lt;/strong&gt; Relaxations for specific cargo types like agricultural products and fertilizers aim to benefit farmers by providing more efficient and cost-effective transportation options.6 The movement of empty containers has also become more streamlined.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Increased Cruise Tourism:&lt;/strong&gt; Relaxation of cabotage for cruise ships has encouraged more frequent visits and movement of passenger vessels between Indian ports, boosting the tourism sector in coastal regions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Negative Impacts and Concerns:&lt;span class=&#34;hx-absolute -hx-mt-20&#34; id=&#34;negative-impacts-and-concerns&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#negative-impacts-and-concerns&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Challenges for Domestic Fleet Owners:&lt;/strong&gt;
The primary concern of Indian shipowners is that increased competition from foreign vessels, which often have lower operating costs due to factors like taxation and crewing regulations, could make Indian-flagged vessels economically uncompetitive. This could lead to reduced business for domestic shipping companies and hinder the growth of the Indian fleet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Security Implications:&lt;/strong&gt;
Some stakeholders have raised concerns about the security implications of allowing foreign-flagged vessels greater access to India&amp;rsquo;s coast.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Uneven Playing Field:&lt;/strong&gt;
Domestic players argue that they face higher operating costs due to factors like higher funding costs, fuel expenses, training requirements, and taxes, creating an uneven playing field when competing with foreign companies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Limited Impact on Overall Modal Shift:&lt;/strong&gt;
While coastal shipping volumes have increased for specific cargo, a significant shift from road and rail to coastal shipping across all sectors may not have materialized to the desired extent due to other factors like infrastructure bottlenecks, last-mile connectivity, and the availability of suitable vessels.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Potential Impact on Government-Owned Ports:&lt;/strong&gt;
Some fear that the benefits of cabotage relaxation might disproportionately favor privately operated minor ports with more flexible tariffs and better infrastructure compared to government-owned major ports.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Policy Evolution in the Last 5 Years:&lt;span class=&#34;hx-absolute -hx-mt-20&#34; id=&#34;policy-evolution-in-the-last-5-years&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#policy-evolution-in-the-last-5-years&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The past 5 years have seen a progressive relaxation of cabotage regulations in India:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2018:&lt;/strong&gt;
A significant step was taken in May 2018 to allow foreign-flagged vessels to carry coastal cargo, specifically laden export-import containers for transhipment and empty containers for repositioning, without specific permission.7 This was later extended to agricultural, horticultural, fisheries, and animal husbandry products, as well as fertilizers.8&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Subsequent Years:&lt;/strong&gt;
The government has continued to emphasize the promotion of coastal shipping and has tasked bodies like the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to identify more cargo that can be shifted to this mode of transport.9 There have also been efforts to integrate inland waterways with coastal shipping.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Future Outlook:&lt;/strong&gt;
The government has indicated plans for a complete removal of cabotage rules for all types of cargo to further boost coastal shipping and trade. However, this move is likely to face continued resistance from domestic shipowners.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion:&lt;span class=&#34;hx-absolute -hx-mt-20&#34; id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#conclusion&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The relaxation of cabotage in India over the past 5 years has had a mixed impact. While it has shown potential in increasing competition, reducing costs for certain cargo, boosting transhipment, and attracting foreign players, it has also raised concerns about the competitiveness of the domestic shipping industry and potential security implications. The long-term impact will depend on how the government addresses the concerns of domestic stakeholders, develops the necessary coastal infrastructure, and creates a truly level playing field to ensure the sustainable growth of Indian shipping alongside increased foreign participation. The complete removal of cabotage, if implemented, could be a game-changer, but its effects will need careful monitoring and management to ensure the overall benefit to the Indian economy and its maritime sector.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Here are the key &lt;strong&gt;international conventions for arbitration&lt;/strong&gt;, along with their salient features and relevance:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. New York Convention (1958)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;hx-absolute -hx-mt-20&#34; id=&#34;1-new-york-convention-1958&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#1-new-york-convention-1958&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Full Name&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;em&gt;United Nations Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scope&lt;/strong&gt;: Ensures uniform enforcement of foreign arbitral awards across 172+ contracting states. Applies to awards made outside the enforcing state or deemed &amp;ldquo;non-domestic&amp;rdquo; under local law .&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Provisions&lt;/strong&gt;:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Article II&lt;/strong&gt;: Requires courts to refer parties to arbitration if a valid written agreement exists.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Article V&lt;/strong&gt;: Lists limited grounds for refusing enforcement (e.g., invalid arbitration agreement, procedural unfairness, or public policy violations) .&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Impact&lt;/strong&gt;: Replaced the Geneva Protocol (1923) and Geneva Convention (1927), becoming the cornerstone of international arbitration .&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. ICSID Convention (1966)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;hx-absolute -hx-mt-20&#34; id=&#34;2-icsid-convention-1966&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#2-icsid-convention-1966&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Full Name&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;em&gt;Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes Between States and Nationals of Other States&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scope&lt;/strong&gt;: Governs investor-state arbitration under the World Bank’s ICSID. Ratified by 158 states .&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Features&lt;/strong&gt;:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Establishes procedural rules for arbitration and conciliation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Awards are enforceable like domestic court judgments in member states (no recourse to national courts) .&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. European Convention on International Commercial Arbitration (1961)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;hx-absolute -hx-mt-20&#34; id=&#34;3-european-convention-on-international-commercial-arbitration-1961&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#3-european-convention-on-international-commercial-arbitration-1961&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scope&lt;/strong&gt;: Streamlines arbitration procedures in Europe, focusing on arbitration agreements and procedural flexibility .&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Distinction&lt;/strong&gt;: Complements the New York Convention but is less widely adopted.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Panama Convention (1975)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;hx-absolute -hx-mt-20&#34; id=&#34;4-panama-convention-1975&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#4-panama-convention-1975&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Full Name&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;em&gt;Inter-American Convention on International Commercial Arbitration&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scope&lt;/strong&gt;: Covers commercial arbitration in the Americas, similar to the New York Convention but with regional focus .&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. UNCITRAL Model Law (1985, amended 2006)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;hx-absolute -hx-mt-20&#34; id=&#34;5-uncitral-model-law-1985-amended-2006&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Status&lt;/strong&gt;: Not a treaty but a framework adopted by 80+ countries to harmonize arbitration laws (e.g., Canada, Australia, India) .&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Aspects&lt;/strong&gt;:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Defines arbitration procedures, interim measures, and award enforcement.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Integrates with the New York Convention for enforcement .&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Arbitration and dispute resolution are processes used to resolve conflicts outside of traditional court litigation. They are often preferred for their efficiency, confidentiality, and flexibility. Here&amp;rsquo;s an overview of both:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Arbitration&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;hx-absolute -hx-mt-20&#34; id=&#34;arbitration&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#arbitration&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Arbitration is a form of alternative dispute resolution (ADR) where a neutral third party, called an arbitrator, hears evidence and arguments from the disputing parties and makes a binding decision. It is commonly used in commercial, labor, and international disputes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Binding Decision&lt;/strong&gt;: The arbitrator&amp;rsquo;s decision (award) is usually final and enforceable in court.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Neutral Arbitrator&lt;/strong&gt;: The arbitrator is chosen by mutual agreement or through an arbitration institution.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Confidentiality&lt;/strong&gt;: Proceedings are private, unlike public court cases.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Flexibility&lt;/strong&gt;: Parties can agree on procedural rules and timelines.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enforceability&lt;/strong&gt;: Arbitration awards are enforceable under international treaties like the New York Convention.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Types of Arbitration:&lt;span class=&#34;hx-absolute -hx-mt-20&#34; id=&#34;types-of-arbitration&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#types-of-arbitration&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ad Hoc Arbitration&lt;/strong&gt;: Parties design the process themselves.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Institutional Arbitration&lt;/strong&gt;: Administered by organizations like the ICC (International Chamber of Commerce) or AAA (American Arbitration Association).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Advantages:&lt;span class=&#34;hx-absolute -hx-mt-20&#34; id=&#34;advantages&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#advantages&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Faster and less expensive than litigation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Expertise of arbitrators in specific fields.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cross-border enforceability.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Disadvantages:&lt;span class=&#34;hx-absolute -hx-mt-20&#34; id=&#34;disadvantages&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#disadvantages&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Limited appeal options.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Costs can still be high in complex cases.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Perceived lack of transparency.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dispute Resolution&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;hx-absolute -hx-mt-20&#34; id=&#34;dispute-resolution&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#dispute-resolution&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dispute resolution is a broader term that encompasses various methods to resolve conflicts, including negotiation, mediation, arbitration, and litigation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Negotiation&lt;/strong&gt;: Parties communicate directly to reach a mutually acceptable solution.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mediation&lt;/strong&gt;: A neutral mediator facilitates discussions to help parties find a voluntary agreement.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Arbitration&lt;/strong&gt;: As described above.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Litigation&lt;/strong&gt;: Resolving disputes through the court system.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Key Features:&lt;span class=&#34;hx-absolute -hx-mt-20&#34; id=&#34;key-features-1&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#key-features-1&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Voluntary or Mandatory&lt;/strong&gt;: Some methods (e.g., mediation) are voluntary, while others (e.g., arbitration) may be required by contract.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Non-Binding or Binding&lt;/strong&gt;: Mediation is typically non-binding, while arbitration is binding.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Collaborative&lt;/strong&gt;: Focuses on preserving relationships, especially in mediation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Advantages:&lt;span class=&#34;hx-absolute -hx-mt-20&#34; id=&#34;advantages-1&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#advantages-1&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tailored solutions for specific disputes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Often faster and less adversarial than litigation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can preserve business or personal relationships.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Disadvantages:&lt;span class=&#34;hx-absolute -hx-mt-20&#34; id=&#34;disadvantages-1&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#disadvantages-1&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;May not be suitable for highly contentious or complex disputes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Non-binding methods (e.g., mediation) may not result in a resolution.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Choosing Between Arbitration and Other Methods&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;hx-absolute -hx-mt-20&#34; id=&#34;choosing-between-arbitration-and-other-methods&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#choosing-between-arbitration-and-other-methods&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The choice depends on factors such as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The nature of the dispute.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Desired speed and cost.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Need for confidentiality.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Relationship between the parties.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enforceability of the outcome.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;International Arbitration&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;hx-absolute -hx-mt-20&#34; id=&#34;international-arbitration&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#international-arbitration&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In cross-border disputes, international arbitration is often preferred due to its neutrality and enforceability under treaties like the New York Convention. Institutions like the ICC, ICSID (International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes), and UNCITRAL (United Nations Commission on International Trade Law) provide frameworks for such disputes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Trends and Developments&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;hx-absolute -hx-mt-20&#34; id=&#34;trends-and-developments&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#trends-and-developments&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Online Dispute Resolution (ODR)&lt;/strong&gt;: Increasing use of technology for virtual arbitration and mediation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sustainability&lt;/strong&gt;: Focus on reducing the environmental impact of dispute resolution processes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Third-Party Funding&lt;/strong&gt;: Growing use of external funding for arbitration cases.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arbitration and dispute resolution are essential tools for resolving conflicts efficiently and effectively, particularly in a globalized world where traditional litigation may not always be practical.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>
        
        
        &lt;h2&gt;What is ABNJ?&lt;span class=&#34;hx-absolute -hx-mt-20&#34; id=&#34;what-is-abnj&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#what-is-abnj&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Areas beyond national jurisdiction (ABNJ) are those parts of the ocean that are not under the control of any one country. They cover about 64% of the ocean&amp;rsquo;s surface and 95% of its volume, making them the largest global commons on Earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ABNJ are home to a wide range of marine life and ecosystems, including many that are unique and found nowhere else on the planet. They also play a vital role in regulating the climate and providing essential resources to people around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, ABNJ are facing a number of challenges, including overfishing, pollution, and climate change. These challenges are interconnected and require a coordinated response from the global community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The conservation and management of resources in ABNJ is governed by a number of international agreements, including the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) and the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD). These agreements provide a framework for cooperation on a range of issues, including fisheries, shipping, and environmental protection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to international agreements, there are also a number of regional and subregional organizations that play a role in the conservation and management of ABNJ resources. These organizations work to coordinate management efforts and develop common standards and practices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Despite the existence of these agreements and organizations, there are still a number of challenges to the effective conservation and management of ABNJ resources. These challenges include:&lt;span class=&#34;hx-absolute -hx-mt-20&#34; id=&#34;despite-the-existence-of-these-agreements-and-organizations-there-are-still-a-number-of-challenges-to-the-effective-conservation-and-management-of-abnj-resources-these-challenges-include&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#despite-the-existence-of-these-agreements-and-organizations-there-are-still-a-number-of-challenges-to-the-effective-conservation-and-management-of-abnj-resources-these-challenges-include&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The fragmentation of the international ocean governance system&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The lack of effective enforcement mechanisms for international agreements&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The capacity constraints of developing countries&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The increasing pressure on marine resources from human activities&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite these challenges, there is a growing recognition of the importance of ABNJ conservation and management. The United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 14 calls for &amp;ldquo;conserving and sustainably using the oceans, seas and marine resources for sustainable development.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;There are a number of things that can be done to improve the conservation and management of ABNJ resources, including:&lt;span class=&#34;hx-absolute -hx-mt-20&#34; id=&#34;there-are-a-number-of-things-that-can-be-done-to-improve-the-conservation-and-management-of-abnj-resources-including&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#there-are-a-number-of-things-that-can-be-done-to-improve-the-conservation-and-management-of-abnj-resources-including&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strengthening international cooperation and coordination&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Improving the enforcement of international agreements&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Building capacity in developing countries&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Promoting sustainable ocean-based economies&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Raising public awareness of the importance of ABNJ conservation and sustainable use
Here are some specific examples of conservation and management measures that are being implemented in ABNJ:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Fishery management:&lt;span class=&#34;hx-absolute -hx-mt-20&#34; id=&#34;fishery-management&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#fishery-management&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regional fisheries management organizations (RFMOs) have been established to manage fisheries in ABNJ. RFMOs set catch limits, establish fishing seasons, and implement other measures to ensure the sustainable management of fish stocks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Marine protected areas:&lt;span class=&#34;hx-absolute -hx-mt-20&#34; id=&#34;marine-protected-areas&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#marine-protected-areas&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Marine protected areas (MPAs) can be used to protect vulnerable marine ecosystems and biodiversity in ABNJ. MPAs can be established through international agreements or by individual countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Pollution prevention and control:&lt;span class=&#34;hx-absolute -hx-mt-20&#34; id=&#34;pollution-prevention-and-control&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#pollution-prevention-and-control&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;A number of international agreements are in place to prevent and control pollution in ABNJ. These agreements address a range of pollutants, including oil, sewage, and hazardous substances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Climate change adaptation:&lt;span class=&#34;hx-absolute -hx-mt-20&#34; id=&#34;climate-change-adaptation&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#climate-change-adaptation&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The impacts of climate change are already being felt in ABNJ, and these impacts are expected to become more severe in the future. A number of international organizations and initiatives are working to help countries adapt to the impacts of climate change in ABNJ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The conservation and management of ABNJ resources is a complex and challenging task. However, it is essential that we find ways to manage these resources sustainably for the benefit of current and future generations.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Athens Convention 1974</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/docs/parta/marlaw/athensconv/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/docs/parta/marlaw/athensconv/</guid>
      <description>
        
        
        &lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;Athens Convention relating to the Carriage of Passengers and their Luggage by Sea (1974)&lt;/strong&gt; is an international maritime treaty that establishes liability rules for passenger injuries, deaths, and luggage loss or damage during sea travel. Here are its &lt;strong&gt;salient features&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Scope of Application&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;hx-absolute -hx-mt-20&#34; id=&#34;1-scope-of-application&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#1-scope-of-application&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Applies to &lt;strong&gt;international carriage&lt;/strong&gt; of passengers by sea on ships registered in a contracting state or under a contracting state’s law.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Covers &lt;strong&gt;commercial voyages&lt;/strong&gt;, including cruises and ferries, but may exclude domestic transport under national laws.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Liability for Passenger Death/Injury&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;hx-absolute -hx-mt-20&#34; id=&#34;2-liability-for-passenger-deathinjury&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#2-liability-for-passenger-deathinjury&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strict Liability (Presumed Fault)&lt;/strong&gt;:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The carrier is &lt;strong&gt;automatically liable&lt;/strong&gt; for passenger injury or death up to a &lt;strong&gt;financial limit&lt;/strong&gt;, unless they prove the incident resulted from:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An act of war/natural disaster (&lt;em&gt;force majeure&lt;/em&gt;),&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The passenger’s own negligence, or&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A third party’s intentional act.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Higher Liability for Negligence&lt;/strong&gt;:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If the carrier is proven &lt;strong&gt;negligent&lt;/strong&gt;, liability limits may be exceeded.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Compensation Limits (as amended by the 2002 Protocol)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;hx-absolute -hx-mt-20&#34; id=&#34;3-compensation-limits-as-amended-by-the-2002-protocol&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#3-compensation-limits-as-amended-by-the-2002-protocol&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Death or Injury&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;strong&gt;250,000 SDR&lt;/strong&gt; (Special Drawing Rights, ~USD 330,000) per passenger.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Luggage Loss/Damage&lt;/strong&gt;:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cabin Luggage&lt;/strong&gt;: 2,250 SDR (~USD 3,000)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vehicles &amp;amp; Contents&lt;/strong&gt;: 12,700 SDR (~USD 17,000)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Other Luggage&lt;/strong&gt;: 3,375 SDR (~USD 4,500)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Mandatory Insurance Requirement (2002 Protocol)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;hx-absolute -hx-mt-20&#34; id=&#34;4-mandatory-insurance-requirement-2002-protocol&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#4-mandatory-insurance-requirement-2002-protocol&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Carriers must maintain &lt;strong&gt;insurance or financial security&lt;/strong&gt; (e.g., P&amp;amp;I Club coverage) to cover claims.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Direct Action&lt;/strong&gt;: Passengers can sue insurers directly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. Time Limits for Claims&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;hx-absolute -hx-mt-20&#34; id=&#34;5-time-limits-for-claims&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#5-time-limits-for-claims&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Injury/Death&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;strong&gt;2 years&lt;/strong&gt; from disembarkation or incident (whichever is later).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Luggage Claims&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;strong&gt;15 days&lt;/strong&gt; for apparent damage; &lt;strong&gt;60 days&lt;/strong&gt; for non-apparent damage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6. Defenses Available to Carriers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;hx-absolute -hx-mt-20&#34; id=&#34;6-defenses-available-to-carriers&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#6-defenses-available-to-carriers&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contributory Negligence&lt;/strong&gt;: Compensation may be reduced if the passenger’s actions contributed to the harm.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Force Majeure&lt;/strong&gt;: No liability for unforeseeable events like wars or natural disasters.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7. Jurisdiction &amp;amp; Enforcement&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;hx-absolute -hx-mt-20&#34; id=&#34;7-jurisdiction--enforcement&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#7-jurisdiction--enforcement&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Claims can be filed in:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The carrier’s principal place of business,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The place of departure/destination, or&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The passenger’s habitual residence (if the carrier operates there).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>Average total Loss (ATL)</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/docs/partc/em303/cargoinsuranceclaims/atl/</link>

      <description>
        
        
        &lt;p&gt;An &lt;strong&gt;average total loss&lt;/strong&gt; in marine cargo insurance occurs when the cost of repairing the damaged cargo or rescuing it is greater than the value of the cargo itself. In this case, the insured is entitled to claim the full value of the cargo from the insurance company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two types of average total loss:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Actual total loss:&lt;/strong&gt; This occurs when the cargo is completely destroyed or lost.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Constructive total loss:&lt;/strong&gt; This occurs when the cost of repairing the damaged cargo or rescuing it is greater than the value of the cargo itself.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To determine whether an average total loss has occurred, the insurance company will consider the following factors:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The cost of repairing the damaged cargo&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The cost of rescuing the damaged cargo&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The value of the cargo&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the cost of repairing or rescuing the cargo is greater than the value of the cargo, then the insurance company will declare an average total loss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the insured chooses to abandon the cargo, the insurance company will take ownership of the cargo and pay the insured the full value of the cargo. If the insured chooses to keep the cargo, the insurance company will pay the insured the cost of repairs, minus the value of the salvage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some examples of average total loss in marine cargo insurance:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A ship carrying a cargo of electronics sinks in a storm. The cargo is completely destroyed, so the insurance company declares an average total loss.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A cargo of perishable goods is damaged in a fire on board a ship. The cost of repairing the damaged cargo is greater than the value of the cargo, so the insurance company declares an average total loss.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A cargo of computers is stolen from a warehouse. The insurance company is unable to locate the stolen cargo, so it declares an average total loss.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Average total loss claims are relatively rare in marine cargo insurance. However, they can be very costly for insurance companies, so it is important for insurers to carefully assess the risk of average total loss before issuing a policy.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Principle of Generation Voltage Control:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generation voltage control, also known as voltage regulation, is crucial in power generation systems to maintain a stable and consistent voltage output. The principle involves adjusting the excitation of the generator to regulate the terminal voltage. The generator&amp;rsquo;s excitation is controlled by varying the DC current supplied to the rotor&amp;rsquo;s magnetic field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Objective:&lt;span class=&#34;hx-absolute -hx-mt-20&#34; id=&#34;objective&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#objective&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The primary objective of generation voltage control is to maintain a constant terminal voltage, despite changes in:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Load current&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Power factor&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Speed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Temperature&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;HeadingAutomatic Voltage Regulator (AVR):&lt;span class=&#34;hx-absolute -hx-mt-20&#34; id=&#34;headingautomatic-voltage-regulator-avr&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#headingautomatic-voltage-regulator-avr&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;An Automatic Voltage Regulator (AVR) is a feedback control system that automatically adjusts the generator&amp;rsquo;s excitation to maintain a constant terminal voltage. The AVR&amp;rsquo;s primary function is to regulate the voltage output by controlling the exciter&amp;rsquo;s output.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Functioning of an Automatic Voltage Regulator:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;HeadingThe AVR consists of the following components:&lt;span class=&#34;hx-absolute -hx-mt-20&#34; id=&#34;headingthe-avr-consists-of-the-following-components&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#headingthe-avr-consists-of-the-following-components&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Voltage Sensor: Measures the generator&amp;rsquo;s terminal voltage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Error Detector: Compares the measured voltage with a set reference voltage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Amplifier: Amplifies the error signal.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exciter: Supplies DC current to the rotor&amp;rsquo;s magnetic field.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Feedback Loop: Continuously monitors the terminal voltage and adjusts the exciter output.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Operation:&lt;span class=&#34;hx-absolute -hx-mt-20&#34; id=&#34;operation&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#operation&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The voltage sensor measures the generator&amp;rsquo;s terminal voltage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The error detector compares the measured voltage with the set reference voltage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If the measured voltage deviates from the reference voltage, an error signal is generated.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The amplifier increases the error signal&amp;rsquo;s magnitude.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The amplified error signal controls the exciter&amp;rsquo;s output.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The exciter adjusts the DC current supplied to the rotor&amp;rsquo;s magnetic field.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The generator&amp;rsquo;s magnetic field strength changes, affecting the terminal voltage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The voltage sensor measures the new terminal voltage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The error detector compares the new voltage with the reference voltage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Steps 3-9 repeat continuously, maintaining a stable terminal voltage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Types of AVRs:&lt;span class=&#34;hx-absolute -hx-mt-20&#34; id=&#34;types-of-avrs&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#types-of-avrs&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Electronic AVRs (using transistors or ICs)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Magnetic AVRs (using magnetic amplifiers)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Static AVRs (using power electronic devices)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Benefits:&lt;span class=&#34;hx-absolute -hx-mt-20&#34; id=&#34;benefits&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#benefits&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maintains stable voltage output&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Improves power quality&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enhances generator efficiency&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reduces wear and tear on equipment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Prevents voltage-related damage&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In summary, the Automatic Voltage Regulator plays a vital role in maintaining a stable and consistent voltage output in power generation systems by continuously adjusting the generator&amp;rsquo;s excitation in response to changes in load, power factor, speed, and temperature.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Azimuth thrusters</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/docs/partb/engg/azimuth-thrusters/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/docs/partb/engg/azimuth-thrusters/</guid>
      <description>
        
        
        &lt;p&gt;Azimuth thrusters are becoming increasingly popular in marine propulsion systems due to their versatility and maneuverability. They are particularly useful in confined spaces, such as harbors and canals, where traditional propellers can be difficult to maneuver.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why are Azimuth Thrusters being used on some of the new buildings?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enhanced Maneuverability:&lt;/strong&gt; Azimuth thrusters can rotate 360 degrees, allowing for precise control and easy docking or maneuvering in tight spaces.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Improved Efficiency:&lt;/strong&gt; Azimuth thrusters can be more efficient than traditional propellers, especially at low speeds, as they can be directly aligned with the vessel&amp;rsquo;s direction of travel.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reduced Noise and Vibration:&lt;/strong&gt; Azimuth thrusters can generate less noise and vibration than traditional propellers, improving comfort for passengers and crew.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Increased Stability:&lt;/strong&gt; Azimuth thrusters can help to improve the stability of a vessel, especially in rough seas.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How would they contribute to changes in the Engine Rooms of vessels?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Simplified Control Systems:&lt;/strong&gt; Azimuth thrusters require more complex control systems than traditional propellers, but these systems can be more efficient and user-friendly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reduced Maintenance:&lt;/strong&gt; Azimuth thrusters generally require less maintenance than traditional propellers, as there are fewer moving parts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Increased Space:&lt;/strong&gt; Azimuth thrusters can be installed in a variety of locations on a vessel, including the stern, bow, and sides. This can free up space in the engine room for other equipment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, Azimuth thrusters are a valuable addition to modern marine propulsion systems. Their versatility, efficiency, and maneuverability make them well-suited for a wide range of vessels, from small tugs to large cruise ships.
&lt;strong&gt;Redundancy in Thruster Systems&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Redundancy in thruster systems is achieved by having multiple thrusters capable of providing the same or similar functions. This ensures that if one thruster fails, the vessel can still maintain propulsion and maneuverability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Common Redundancy Strategies:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Multiple Thruster Configurations:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dual-screw:&lt;/strong&gt; Two propellers located at the stern.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quadruple-screw:&lt;/strong&gt; Four propellers located at the stern.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Azipod:&lt;/strong&gt; Two or more azimuth thrusters located at the stern or sides of the vessel.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Podded Propulsion:&lt;/strong&gt; Similar to Azipods, but with the electric motor and propeller enclosed in a pod.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Emergency Power Systems:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Backup generators:&lt;/strong&gt; To provide power to the thrusters in case of a main power failure.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Emergency batteries:&lt;/strong&gt; For short-term backup power.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Redundant Control Systems:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Multiple control stations for the thrusters.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Backup control systems in case of a failure.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Benefits of Redundancy:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enhanced safety:&lt;/strong&gt; Redundancy reduces the risk of complete propulsion loss due to a single thruster failure.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Improved maneuverability:&lt;/strong&gt; Multiple thrusters provide greater control and flexibility in maneuvering.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Increased reliability:&lt;/strong&gt; Redundancy can improve the overall reliability of the propulsion system.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By implementing redundancy in thruster systems, vessel operators can significantly enhance the safety and reliability of their operations, especially in critical situations such as emergencies or harsh weather conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Bailment</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/docs/parta/marlaw/bailment/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/docs/parta/marlaw/bailment/</guid>
      <description>
        
        
        &lt;p&gt;A &lt;strong&gt;bailment&lt;/strong&gt; is a legal relationship that arises when one person (the &lt;strong&gt;bailor&lt;/strong&gt;) delivers goods to another person (the &lt;strong&gt;bailee&lt;/strong&gt;) for a specific purpose, with the understanding that the goods will be returned to the bailor or disposed of according to their directions once the purpose is accomplished.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Definition:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Section 148 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872, defines bailment as &amp;ldquo;the delivery of goods by one person to another for some purpose, upon a contract that they shall, when the purpose is accomplished, be returned or otherwise disposed of according to the directions of the person delivering them.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Essentials of Bailment:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Delivery of Goods:&lt;/strong&gt; There must be a transfer of possession of goods from the bailor to the bailee. This doesn&amp;rsquo;t necessarily mean physical transfer; it can also be constructive (e.g., giving the key to a warehouse).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Purpose:&lt;/strong&gt; The goods must be delivered for a specific purpose, such as safe custody, repair, transportation, or processing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contract:&lt;/strong&gt; There must be a contract between the bailor and the bailee, which can be express or implied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Return or Disposal:&lt;/strong&gt; There must be an understanding that the goods will be returned to the bailor or disposed of according to their instructions after the purpose of the bailment is fulfilled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ownership Remains with Bailor:&lt;/strong&gt; The bailor retains ownership of the goods throughout the bailment. Only possession is transferred to the bailee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Duties of the Bailor:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disclosure of Known Faults (Section 150):&lt;/strong&gt; The bailor is bound to disclose to the bailee faults in the goods bailed, of which the bailor is aware, and which materially interfere with the use of them, or expose the bailee to extraordinary risks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To Bear Extraordinary Expenses (Section 158):&lt;/strong&gt; The bailor must repay to the bailee the necessary expenses incurred by them for the purpose of the bailment. If the bailment is gratuitous (without any charge), the bailor must also bear any extraordinary expenses incurred by the bailee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To Indemnify the Bailee for Loss Due to Defective Title (Section 164):&lt;/strong&gt; The bailor is responsible to indemnify the bailee for any loss which the bailee may sustain by reason that the bailor was not entitled to make the bailment, or to receive back the goods, or to give directions respecting them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Liabilities of the Bailee:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Duty of Reasonable Care (Sections 151 and 152):&lt;/strong&gt; The bailee is bound to take as much care of the goods bailed to them as a man of ordinary prudence would, under similar circumstances, take of his own goods of the same bulk, quality, and value as the goods bailed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Not to Make Unauthorized Use of Goods (Section 154):&lt;/strong&gt; If the bailee makes any use of the goods bailed which is not according to the conditions of the bailment, they are liable to make compensation to the bailor for any damage arising to the goods from or during such use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Not to Mix Goods (Sections 155-157):&lt;/strong&gt; The bailee must not mix the bailor&amp;rsquo;s goods with their own. If they do so with the bailor&amp;rsquo;s consent, both parties have a proportionate interest in the mixture. If they do so without consent, and the goods can be separated, the bailee is liable for the expenses of separation and any damage arising from the mixture. If the goods cannot be separated, the bailee is liable for the loss of the goods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To Return the Goods (Section 160):&lt;/strong&gt; It is the bailee&amp;rsquo;s duty to return the goods to the bailor according to the bailor&amp;rsquo;s directions, without demand, as soon as the time for which they were bailed has expired, or the purpose for which they were bailed has been accomplished.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rights of the Bailee:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Right to Compensation for Expenses (Sections 158 and 159):&lt;/strong&gt; The bailee has the right to be reimbursed for expenses incurred in keeping or preserving the goods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Right of Lien (Sections 170-171):&lt;/strong&gt; The bailee has a right to retain possession of the goods until they receive due remuneration for their services in respect of the goods. This is known as a particular lien (for services related to those specific goods). Some bailees, like bankers, factors, and wharfingers, have a general lien (for any balance due).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Right of Action Against Wrongdoers (Section 180):&lt;/strong&gt; If a third person wrongfully deprives the bailee of the use or possession of the goods bailed, or does them any injury, the bailee is entitled to use such remedies as the owner might have used in the like case if no bailment had been made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ports as Bailee of Cargo:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ports often act as bailees of cargo that passes through their facilities. They take temporary possession of goods for the purpose of storage, handling, and transportation. As bailees, ports have a duty to exercise reasonable care in handling and storing the cargo. They can also exercise a lien on the goods for unpaid dues, such as port charges and handling fees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Examples of Bailment:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Leaving a car with a mechanic for repairs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Depositing valuables in a bank locker.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hiring a dress for an event.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Giving clothes to a dry cleaner.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Storing goods in a warehouse.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding bailment is crucial in various commercial and personal situations involving the temporary transfer of possession of goods. It defines the responsibilities and rights of both the bailor and the bailee.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Banking Law&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Banking law is a body of law that regulates banks and other financial institutions. It covers a wide range of topics, including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Establishment and Licensing of Banks:&lt;/strong&gt; Laws governing the formation, licensing, and supervision of banks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Banking Operations:&lt;/strong&gt; Rules relating to deposit accounts, loans, payment systems, and other banking services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bank Regulation and Supervision:&lt;/strong&gt; Laws and regulations designed to ensure the safety and soundness of the banking system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Consumer Protection:&lt;/strong&gt; Laws protecting consumers in their dealings with banks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Legislation Governing Banking in India:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Banking Regulation Act, 1949:&lt;/strong&gt; This is the primary legislation governing banking in India. It provides for the licensing, regulation, and supervision of banks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934:&lt;/strong&gt; This Act established the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), the central bank of India, and gives it the authority to regulate the banking system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881:&lt;/strong&gt; This Act deals with negotiable instruments such as promissory notes, bills of exchange, and checks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Negotiable Instruments&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A negotiable instrument is a document that represents a right to payment of a specific sum of money. It can be transferred from one person to another, and the holder in due course (a bona fide purchaser for value) takes it free from most defenses that could be raised against the original holder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Characteristics of Negotiable Instruments:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Free Transferability:&lt;/strong&gt; Negotiable instruments can be easily transferred from one person to another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Holder in Due Course:&lt;/strong&gt; A holder in due course takes the instrument free from most defenses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Certainty of Amount:&lt;/strong&gt; The amount payable must be certain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unconditional Order or Promise:&lt;/strong&gt; The instrument must contain an unconditional order or promise to pay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Types of Negotiable Instruments:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Promissory Note:&lt;/strong&gt; A written promise by one person (the maker) to pay a certain sum of money to another person (the payee).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bill of Exchange:&lt;/strong&gt; A written order by one person (the drawer) to another person (the drawee) to pay a certain sum of money to a third person (the payee).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Check:&lt;/strong&gt; A bill of exchange drawn on a bank and payable on demand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This Act governs negotiable instruments in India. Key provisions include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Definitions of Negotiable Instruments:&lt;/strong&gt; The Act defines promissory notes, bills of exchange, and checks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Negotiation:&lt;/strong&gt; The Act sets out the rules for transferring negotiable instruments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Presentment:&lt;/strong&gt; The Act specifies the rules for presenting negotiable instruments for payment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dishonor:&lt;/strong&gt; The Act deals with the consequences of dishonor of negotiable instruments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Liability of Parties:&lt;/strong&gt; The Act defines the liability of various parties to a negotiable instrument.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Relationship between Banking Law and Negotiable Instruments:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Negotiable instruments play a crucial role in banking transactions. Checks, for example, are widely used for making payments and transferring funds. The Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881, provides the legal framework for these transactions, while banking law regulates the banks that facilitate them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In summary, banking law and the law relating to negotiable instruments are closely intertwined, providing the legal foundation for financial transactions in India.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>
        
        
        &lt;h2&gt;Hydrographic surveying&lt;span class=&#34;hx-absolute -hx-mt-20&#34; id=&#34;hydrographic-surveying&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#hydrographic-surveying&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;is a complex and demanding field, but it is also essential for safe navigation and maritime transportation. Hydrographic surveyors use a variety of techniques to collect data about the depth and position of underwater features. This data is then used to create nautical charts, which are essential for ships and boats to navigate safely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Here are some additional details about the basic techniques of hydrographic surveying:&lt;span class=&#34;hx-absolute -hx-mt-20&#34; id=&#34;here-are-some-additional-details-about-the-basic-techniques-of-hydrographic-surveying&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#here-are-some-additional-details-about-the-basic-techniques-of-hydrographic-surveying&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sounding:&lt;/strong&gt; Sounding is a relatively simple technique, but it can be very effective in shallow waters. To sound, a hydrographic surveyor will lower a weighted line, called a sounding lead, to the bottom of the water and then measure the depth. Sounding is typically done from a small boat, but it can also be done from shore or from a helicopter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Echo sounding:&lt;/strong&gt; Echo sounding is a more advanced technique that uses sound waves to measure the depth of water. An echo sounder emits a sound wave and then measures the time it takes for the wave to return to the surface. The depth of the water is then calculated based on the speed of sound in water. Echo sounding is more accurate than sounding and can be used to survey large areas of water quickly and efficiently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Side scan sonar:&lt;/strong&gt; Side scan sonar is a type of sonar that uses sound waves to create images of the seafloor. A side scan sonar system emits sound waves to the sides of a survey vessel and then measures the returning echoes. The echoes are then used to create a two-dimensional image of the seafloor. Side scan sonar is useful for detecting underwater features, such as shipwrecks and pipelines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Multibeam sonar:&lt;/strong&gt; Multibeam sonar is the most advanced type of sonar used in hydrographic surveying. It emits multiple sound beams in different directions to create a three-dimensional image of the seafloor. Multibeam sonar is the most accurate and efficient method of hydrographic surveying, but it is also the most expensive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to measuring depth, hydrographic surveys also collect information about the position of underwater features. This information is collected using a variety of positioning technologies, such as GPS, Differential Global Positioning System (DGPS), and Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the depth and positioning data has been collected, it is processed using specialized software to create a nautical chart. Nautical charts show the depth of water, the position of underwater features, and other important information for navigation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hydrographic surveys are conducted in a variety of environments, including oceans, lakes, rivers, and harbors. The specific techniques used will vary depending on the environment and the purpose of the survey. For example, a hydrographic survey of a shallow river might use sounding and GPS to measure the depth and position of the riverbed. A hydrographic survey of a deep ocean might use multibeam sonar and GNSS to create a detailed three-dimensional image of the seafloor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hydrographic surveying is an essential part of safe navigation and maritime transportation. Hydrographic surveyors collect the data that is used to create nautical charts, which are essential for ships and boats to navigate safely. Hydrographic surveys are also used for a variety of other purposes, such as coastal engineering, environmental monitoring, and marine research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Here are some examples of how hydrographic surveying is used in the real world:&lt;span class=&#34;hx-absolute -hx-mt-20&#34; id=&#34;here-are-some-examples-of-how-hydrographic-surveying-is-used-in-the-real-world&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#here-are-some-examples-of-how-hydrographic-surveying-is-used-in-the-real-world&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hydrographic surveys are used to create nautical charts for commercial and recreational shipping.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hydrographic surveys are used to map the seabed for coastal engineering projects, such as building new ports and harbors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hydrographic surveys are used to monitor environmental changes, such as coastal erosion and sea level rise.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hydrographic surveys are used to support marine research, such as studying the distribution of marine life and mapping the location of hydrothermal vents.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hydrographic surveying is a vital field that plays a critical role in the safety and efficiency of maritime transportation. Hydrographic surveyors use a variety of advanced techniques to collect data about the depth and position of underwater features. This data is then used to create nautical charts and support a variety of other important applications.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Bathymetric Studies</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/docs/partc/em301/oceanogeo/bathy/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>
        
        
        &lt;h2&gt;What are Bathymetric Studies?&lt;span class=&#34;hx-absolute -hx-mt-20&#34; id=&#34;what-are-bathymetric-studies&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#what-are-bathymetric-studies&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bathymetric studies are essential for understanding the oceans. They provide information about the depth and shape of the seafloor, which can be used to map ocean currents, identify potential hazards, and understand the distribution of marine life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Methods of Bathymetric Studies&lt;span class=&#34;hx-absolute -hx-mt-20&#34; id=&#34;methods-of-bathymetric-studies&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#methods-of-bathymetric-studies&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two common methods of bathymetric data collection are precision depth recorders (PDRs) and side-scan sonar (SOPAR).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Precision depth recorders (PDRs) are acoustic devices that measure the depth of the seafloor by sending out a sound pulse and recording the time it takes for the echo to return. PDRs are typically mounted on the bottom of a ship or other vessel, and they can provide accurate depth measurements at high speeds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Side-scan sonar (SOPAR) is a type of sonar that uses sound waves to create images of the seafloor. SOPAR systems typically consist of two transducers that are mounted on the sides of a vessel. The transducers emit sound waves that bounce off the seafloor and are received by the other transducer. The difference in arrival time of the two echoes is used to create an image of the seafloor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How is the Bathymetric Data used?&lt;span class=&#34;hx-absolute -hx-mt-20&#34; id=&#34;how-is-the-bathymetric-data-used&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#how-is-the-bathymetric-data-used&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bathymetric data collected using PDRs and SOPAR can be used to create detailed maps of the seafloor. These maps can be used for a variety of purposes, including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mapping ocean currents: The depth and shape of the seafloor can influence the movement of ocean currents. Bathymetric data can be used to create models of ocean currents, which can be used to predict their behavior and impact on shipping, fisheries, and other human activities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Identifying potential hazards: Bathymetric data can be used to identify potential hazards such as underwater mountains, shipwrecks, and unexploded ordnance. This information can be used to avoid these hazards and reduce the risk of accidents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding the distribution of marine life: The depth and shape of the seafloor can also influence the distribution of marine life. Bathymetric data can be used to identify areas that are suitable for different types of marine life, which can be used to inform conservation and management efforts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to these specific applications, bathymetric data is also essential for basic research on the oceans. For example, bathymetric data can be used to study the formation and evolution of ocean basins, the movement of tectonic plates, and the impact of climate change on the oceans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, bathymetric studies play a vital role in our understanding of the oceans. PDRs and SOPAR are two common methods of bathymetric data collection that provide accurate and high-resolution data. This data can be used for a variety of purposes, including mapping ocean currents, identifying potential hazards, and understanding the distribution of marine life.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Bill of Lading</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/docs/partc/em303/cshipmgmt/billoflading/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/docs/partc/em303/cshipmgmt/billoflading/</guid>
      <description>
        
        
        &lt;p&gt;A bill of lading (BOL) is a legal document issued by a carrier (or their agent) to acknowledge receipt of cargo for shipment. It is a contract between the shipper, carrier, and consignee (receiver of the goods), and it serves several important functions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It acts as a receipt for the goods, confirming that the carrier has taken possession of them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It describes the goods being shipped, including their quantity, type, condition, and packaging.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It specifies the origin and destination of the shipment, as well as the agreed-upon transportation terms.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It serves as a contract of carriage, outlining the responsibilities of the carrier in transporting the goods safely and on time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It can be used as a document of title, meaning that the party holding it has the right to claim ownership of the goods.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bills of lading are used for all types of shipments, including domestic and international, and by all modes of transportation, including truck, rail, air, and ship. They are particularly important in international trade, where they play a vital role in facilitating the movement of goods and ensuring that all parties involved in the transaction are protected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two main types of bills of lading:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Straight bill of lading:&lt;/strong&gt; This type of bill of lading is non-negotiable, meaning that it cannot be transferred to another party. It is typically used when the goods are being shipped directly to the consignee.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Order bill of lading:&lt;/strong&gt; This type of bill of lading is negotiable, meaning that it can be transferred to another party by endorsement. This makes it a valuable financial instrument, as it can be used to secure financing for the shipment or to sell the goods to another party before they have arrived at their destination.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bills of lading are typically issued in three original copies, one for the shipper, one for the carrier, and one for the consignee. However, additional copies may be issued if needed, for example, for insurance purposes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some of the key benefits of using bills of lading:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;They provide a clear and concise record of the shipment.&lt;/strong&gt; This can be helpful in resolving disputes or tracking down lost or damaged goods.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;They help to protect the interests of all parties involved in the shipment.&lt;/strong&gt; The carrier is legally obligated to comply with the terms of the bill of lading, and the shipper and consignee have recourse if the carrier fails to do so.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;They can be used to facilitate financing and other financial transactions.&lt;/strong&gt; The negotiable nature of order bills of lading makes them a valuable financial instrument.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, bills of lading are an essential part of the shipping process. They provide a number of important benefits to all parties involved, and they help to ensure the safe and efficient movement of goods around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bill of Lading under Charter Party&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Three (3) Functions of Bill of Lading (B/L):&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;hx-absolute -hx-mt-20&#34; id=&#34;three-3-functions-of-bill-of-lading-bl&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#three-3-functions-of-bill-of-lading-bl&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;1- Evidence of a Contract&lt;br&gt;
2- Receipt &lt;br&gt;
3- Document of Title (DOT)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1- Evidence of a Contract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;hx-absolute -hx-mt-20&#34; id=&#34;1--evidence-of-a-contract&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#1--evidence-of-a-contract&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The contract to ship cargo is made well before the Bill of Lading (B/L) is signed. Therefore, when it is first produced the Bill of Lading (B/L) cannot be the contract itself. Nevertheless, a Bill of Lading (B/L) is evidence that there is a contract of shipment between the Shipper and the Carrier (Shipowner or Ship Operator). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Ardennes (1950) case, the Shipper was worried that the consignment of Spanish oranges should reach London before a scheduled increase in import duty and obtained an assurance that the vessel would proceed directly to London. On the way, the Shipowner decided to make Antwerp the vessel’s first port of discharge so that the oranges did not reach London until after the critical date. The Shipowner attempted to claim their right under the Liberties Clause in the printed wording of the Bill of Lading (B/L). However, Lord Goddard, in establishing the Shipper’s right to recover damages for breach of contract, highlighted that the contract, albeit a verbal contract, came into existence before the Bill of Lading (B/L) was signed. Furthermore, Lord Goddard, to underline the fact that a Bill of Lading (B/L) was not the contract, pointed out that a Bill of Lading (B/L) is only signed by one party. Therefore, a Bill of Lading (B/L) is evidence of a contract. Undoubtedly, a Bill of Lading (B/L) is considered the** best evidence of a contract**. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Endorsed Bills of Lading (B/L)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;hx-absolute -hx-mt-20&#34; id=&#34;endorsed-bills-of-lading-bl&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#endorsed-bills-of-lading-bl&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the Bill of Lading (B/L) is transferred to an &lt;strong&gt;Endorsee&lt;/strong&gt;, then the Bill of Lading (B/L) is the contract of carriage between the Endorsee and the Carrier. The terms of carriage will be those clauses incorporated in the Bill of Lading (B/L) itself. Therefore, an Endorsee of a Bill of Lading (B/L) is not affected by any contract between the Shipper and the Carrier. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the Carrier (Shipowner or Ship Operator) wants to incorporate into Bills of Lading (B/L) a clause that is completely out of keeping with the customary procedure, the Carrier (Shipowner or Ship Operator) ought not only to make it obvious in words but also to make it apparent by inserting it in such style and such part of the Bills of Lading (B/L) that an individual of ordinary capacity could not fail to notice unusual term. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bill of Lading (B/L) is not the contract but simply evidence of the contract. It does not follow that an individual, who accepts the Bill of Lading (B/L) that the Carrier delivers, is required and without regard to circumstances bound to abide by all Bill of Lading’s (B/L) terms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a Charterer employs the vessel to carry cargo for himself, then the Bill of Lading (B/L) is a Receipt and maybe a Document of Title (DOT) as well for the cargo. In this case, the Bill of Lading (B/L) is neither Evidence of nor the Contract of carriage. The Charterparty retains the contract for the carriage of the cargo between the Charterer and the Carrier (Shipowner or Ship Operator). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the Shipper is not the Consignee, the Bill of Lading (B/L) is the contract of carriage between the Carrier (Shipowner or Ship Operator) and the Consignee or Endorsee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bill of Lading (B/L) on Time Charter (T/C)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;hx-absolute -hx-mt-20&#34; id=&#34;bill-of-lading-bl-on-time-charter-tc&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#bill-of-lading-bl-on-time-charter-tc&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Issues may arise when the vessel is on Time Charter (T/C). Who is the Carrier in the contract of carriage under Time Charter (T/C)? The Voyage Charterer (Shipper) made a contract with the Time Charterer (Disponent Shipowner).  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a cargo claim arises the Voyage Charterer’s (Shipper’s) first recourse is inherently against the Time Charterer (Disponent Shipowner) although the damage to the cargo may have been the fault of the vessel. Where the issue can escalate is if the Time Charterer (Disponent Shipowner) is late in dealing with the claim and the Voyage Charterer (Shipper) decides to arrest the ship. Almost invariably, Time Charterparties have clauses that rule how these issues are resolved particularly where the Ship Master is required to sign the Bill of Lading (B/L) on behalf of the Time Charterer (Disponent Shipowner).   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2- Receipt&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;hx-absolute -hx-mt-20&#34; id=&#34;2--receipt&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#2--receipt&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bill of Lading (B/L) stipulates the &lt;strong&gt;quantity&lt;/strong&gt; and the &lt;strong&gt;details&lt;/strong&gt; of cargoes. In non-containerized cargoes, Bills of Lading (B/L) stipulate the number of tonnes and/or the volume of the cargoes in cubic meters. Furthermore, Bill of Lading (B/L) stipulates any identifying marks or numbers of cargoes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bill of Lading (B/L) stipulates the &lt;strong&gt;condition&lt;/strong&gt; of the cargoes when loaded on board. In most Bill of Lading (B/L), the expression “apparent good order and condition” is incorporated. If the “apparent good order and condition” expression is unqualified the Bill of Lading (B/L) is referred to as being a** Clean Bill of Lading (B/L)**. If the cargoes are not in apparent good order and condition then the Bill of Lading (B/L) is referred to as being a &lt;strong&gt;Claused Bill of Lading (B/L)&lt;/strong&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In container shipping, if the cargo is delivered as an FCL (Full Container Load), the Carrier has no way of knowing either the quantity or condition of the cargo themselves and beyond checking that the weight of the container does not exceed its permitted load, the Bill of Lading (B/L) will only show the Container Number. Furthermore, if the Shipper requires a reference to the contents of the container, the Bill of Lading (B/L) will include the expression “said to contain”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In dry bulk shipping, there is no accurate method for the Ship Master to check the weight of the cargo. A Draft Survey is a reasonable inspection but by no means precise. Consequently, in dry bulk shipping, it is customary for the Bill of Lading (B/L) under a Charterparty to express the weight as &lt;strong&gt;Works Weight&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;Docks Weight&lt;/strong&gt;, followed by the expression “weight shipped unknown”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3- Document of Title (DOT)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;hx-absolute -hx-mt-20&#34; id=&#34;3--document-of-title-dot&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#3--document-of-title-dot&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bill of Lading (B/L) function as a Document of Title is threefold:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3.1- Negotiable Document&lt;br&gt;
3.2- Claim Cargoes&lt;br&gt;
3.3- Security for Payment&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3.1- Negotiable Document&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;hx-absolute -hx-mt-20&#34; id=&#34;31--negotiable-document&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#31--negotiable-document&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bill of Lading (B/L) is a Negotiable Document. In other words, Bill of Lading (B/L) is a &lt;strong&gt;Transferable Documents&lt;/strong&gt;. What the transfer of Negotiable Bill of Lading (B/L) does pass is &lt;strong&gt;Constructive Possession&lt;/strong&gt; of the cargoes. In other words, the right to demand of the Carrier the delivery of the cargoes on presentation of the Bills of Lading (B/L). There is** no limit** to the number of times Bill of Lading (B/L) can be sold-on when the cargoes are still in transit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3.2- Claim Cargoes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;hx-absolute -hx-mt-20&#34; id=&#34;32--claim-cargoes&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#32--claim-cargoes&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bill of Lading (B/L) enable the &lt;strong&gt;Bill of Lading (B/L) Holder&lt;/strong&gt; to claim cargoes. The Carrier must only deliver the cargo to the Bill of Lading (B/L) Holder. Therefore, Bill of Lading (B/L) are important documents. Bill of Lading (B/L) is the key to the cargo. The Carrier will not be justified in delivering the cargo to anyone other than the Bill of Lading (B/L) Holder or Bill of Lading (B/L) Holder’s Agent unless there is a particular custom of the port or an Express Agreement to the contrary in the Charterparty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3.3- Security for Payment&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;hx-absolute -hx-mt-20&#34; id=&#34;33--security-for-payment&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#33--security-for-payment&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bill of Lading’s (B/L) third function as a Document of Title (DOT) is a Security for Payment. At the time of cargo shipment, in a case where freight is to be paid on completion of loading, the Carrier or the Carrier’s Agent will not hand over Bill of Lading (B/L) expressing Freight Prepaid without first receiving payment. Furthermore, the function of security for payment materializes when payment for the cargo is via a documentary Letter of Credit (L/C).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;International Trade and Bill of Lading (B/L)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;hx-absolute -hx-mt-20&#34; id=&#34;international-trade-and-bill-of-lading-bl&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#international-trade-and-bill-of-lading-bl&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In cases where the Shipper has sold the cargoes under a Letter of Credit (L/C) opened through a bank or in cases where the Shipper wants to receive payment before the Consignee receives the cargoes, the Shipper will pass the Original Bill of Lading (B/L) to the bank who, in due course, will arrange a presentation to the Consignee against payment of the cargoes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, most international trade payments are completed via Letter of Credit (L/C). Bills of Lading (B/L) are deemed as a Document of Title to the cargoes. Banks do not want to take actual possession of the cargo. However, Bills of Lading (B/L) allow the banks to facilitate payment for the cargo from the buyer to the seller. If there is any default in payment, the bank could indeed become the actual possessor of the cargo but this is only a last resort position. Therefore, the strictest accuracy of the details in the description of the cargo should appear on the Bills of Lading (B/L). Credit is extended based on a bank’s faith in the facts of the expressed description of the cargo in the Bills of Lading (B/L) and any other documentation the Letter of Credit (L/C) may require:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1- Cargo Invoice &lt;br&gt;
2- Cargo Marine Insurance Policy &lt;br&gt;
3- Consular Documents &lt;br&gt;
4- Cargo Export License&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Claused Bill of Lading (B/L) and Letters of Indemnity (LOI)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;hx-absolute -hx-mt-20&#34; id=&#34;claused-bill-of-lading-bl-and-letters-of-indemnity-loi&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#claused-bill-of-lading-bl-and-letters-of-indemnity-loi&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Banks do not accept Bill of Lading (B/L) that contain any wording to indicate that the cargo, when received on board the ship, was in other than &lt;strong&gt;Apparent Good Order and Condition&lt;/strong&gt;. If any remark appears, the Bill of Lading (B/L) is known as Claused (Unclean) Bill of Lading (B/L). Similarly, banks do not accept Bill of Lading (B/L) that is not &lt;strong&gt;Shipped on Board Bill of Lading (B/L)&lt;/strong&gt;. In other words, banks do not accept &lt;strong&gt;Received for Shipment Bill of Lading (B/L)&lt;/strong&gt; which meanscargo is not loaded on board the ship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Usually, the Shipper seeks to present a Letter of Indemnity (LOI) to the Carrier (Shipowner or Ship Operator) which will hold the Carrier (Shipowner or Ship Operator) harmless against the issuance of Clean Bill of Lading (B/L) when in reality the cargo to be shipped is damaged or defective when loaded on the ship. Issuing Clean Bill of Lading (B/L) against a damaged or defective cargo is &lt;strong&gt;Fraud&lt;/strong&gt; and such a Letter of Indemnity (LOI) is not worth the paper it is written on. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Brown Jenkinson &amp;amp; Co V Percy Dalton (1957) case, an agreement between the Shipper and the Carrier’s (Shipowner or Ship Operator) Agent, whereby the Carrier’s (Shipowner or Ship Operator) Agent agreed to accept from the Shipper the issue of a Letter of Indemnity (LOI) in exchange for the issue of &lt;strong&gt;Clean Bill of Lading (B/L)&lt;/strong&gt; in respect of damaged or defective cargo, was considered by the Court of Appeal to be illegal and unenforceable in the eyes of the law. Undoubtedly, all the elements of the Tort of Deceit were present when the Carrier’s (Shipowner or Ship Operator) Agent made a False Representation which they intended should be relied upon by the receivers of the Bill of Lading (B/L) and the bank.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any Bill of Lading (B/L) intended for negotiation through a Letter of Credit (L/C) must be issued &lt;strong&gt;To Order&lt;/strong&gt; without any reference to a Consignee. However, Bills of Lading (B/L) may incorporate a space to name a &lt;strong&gt;Notify Party&lt;/strong&gt;. Then, the Bill of Lading (B/L) has to be endorsed by the Shipper which then opens the Bill of Lading (B/L). In other words, anyone holding such Bill of Lading (B/L) can claim title to the cargo even if that person picked up the Bills of Lading (B/L) in the street. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bill of Lading (B/L) under Charter Party&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;hx-absolute -hx-mt-20&#34; id=&#34;bill-of-lading-bl-under-charter-party&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#bill-of-lading-bl-under-charter-party&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If a Bill of Lading (B/L) is issued under a Charter Party (Contract of Carriage), the Bill of Lading (B/L) ceases to be considered evidence of this contract. In any contract of carriage which is incorporated in a Charterparty, it is the Charterparty itself that is the contract. Accordingly, the Bill of Lading (B/L) regarding this contract serves simply as a Document of Title (DOT) and as a Receipt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the Bill of Lading (B/L) is endorsed to a Third Party (Endorsee), then there is at this point a new and second contract. In this case, the Bill of Lading (B/L) is now deemed as evidence of this second contract.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Incorporation of Charterparty Clauses into Bill of Lading (B/L)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;hx-absolute -hx-mt-20&#34; id=&#34;incorporation-of-charterparty-clauses-into-bill-of-lading-bl&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#incorporation-of-charterparty-clauses-into-bill-of-lading-bl&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bills of Lading (B/L) are generally expressed to incorporate the terms and conditions of the Charterparty. How and which provisions are incorporated into the Bills of Lading (B/L) depends primarily on the wording used in the incorporating clause. Only the clauses that are **Expressly Incorporated **into the Bills of Lading (B/L) will be considered as being so incorporated. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where the cargo has been loaded on a chartered vessel, the Bills of Lading (B/L) usually incorporate a clause expressing &lt;strong&gt;all other conditions and exceptions as per Charterparty&lt;/strong&gt;. Nevertheless, the incorporating clause does not incorporate provisions that are inconsistent with the Bills of Lading (B/L) or which do not affect the consignee’s right to take delivery. Conclusive Evidence Clause is not considered by the Court to be an exception nor is it considered to be a condition to be performed by a consignee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a clause in the Bills of Lading (B/L) to incorporate some or all of the terms of the Charterparty, such a clause must be **unambiguous **and &lt;strong&gt;express&lt;/strong&gt;. Whether the terms of a Charterparty have been incorporated into the Bills of Lading (B/L) is in each case a matter of construction. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, the former interpretation of such clauses as “all terms, conditions, clauses, and exceptions contained in the Charterparty will apply to the Bills of Lading (B/L)” does not be deemed adequate to incorporate any term of the Charterparty which is inconsistent with any Express Term in the Bills of Lading (B/L). Consequently, care must be taken with such incorporation clauses to avoid the possibility of conflicts materializing at a later time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Incorporation issues become critical when the Bills of Lading (B/L) are transferred from the Charterer to a Third Party (Endorsee) because the Endorsee is not a party to the Charterparty. Therefore, this is where a new contractual case materializes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The wording of the Bills of Lading (B/L) is the starting pinpoint. A Charterparty clause that is not directly appropriate to the load, carriage, or delivery of the cargoes should not be incorporated into the Bills of Lading (B/L) unless by Express Terms. Even a term that is proper may not be incorporated into the Bills of Lading (B/L) if that term is the proper construction of the relevant contract.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Incorporation Clause:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;hx-absolute -hx-mt-20&#34; id=&#34;incorporation-clause&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#incorporation-clause&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;a- The incorporating clause must be construed to see whether incorporating clause is broad enough to bring about the incorporation of the relevant term. General phrases of incorporation will be effective to incorporate only those terms of the charter which relate to the shipment carriage or discharge of the cargo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;b- The term to be incorporated must make sense in the context of the Bills of Lading (B/L); if the incorporated term does not, it must be rejected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;c- The term to be incorporated must be consistent with the Express Terms of the Bills of Lading (B/L); If the incorporated term is not, it will be rejected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Arbitration Clause&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;hx-absolute -hx-mt-20&#34; id=&#34;arbitration-clause&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#arbitration-clause&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Arbitration Clause should be directly stipulated in the Bills of Lading (B/L). The parties should not rely upon general terms to accomplish incorporation. Charterparty Arbitration Clause is incorporated into Bills of Lading (B/L) if either there are specific expressions of incorporation in the Bills of Lading (B/L), the Arbitration Clause is so framed as to make sense in the context of the Bills of Lading (B/L) and the clause does not contradict with the Express Terms of the Bills of Lading (B/L); or there are general expressions of incorporation in the Bills of Lading (B/L) and the Arbitration Clause or some other provision in the Charterparty makes it clear that the clause is to govern disagreements under the Bills of Lading (B/L) as well as under the charter. In all other cases, the Charterparty arbitration clause is not incorporated into the Bills of Lading (B/L). A clause aiming to incorporate “all conditions as per charter party” would not express an Arbitration Clause, and a Charterparty Arbitration Clause referring Charterparty disagreements to arbitration could not be manipulated in such a way as to include the Bills of Lading (B/L) disagreements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who is the Carrier in the Bills of Lading (B/L)?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;hx-absolute -hx-mt-20&#34; id=&#34;who-is-the-carrier-in-the-bills-of-lading-bl&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#who-is-the-carrier-in-the-bills-of-lading-bl&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the Bill of Lading (B/L) Holder is not the Charterer the question emerges as to whether it is the Shipowner or the Charterer that the Bill of Lading (B/L) Holder sues for damage to the cargo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In most cases, the Bills of Lading (B/L) are issued by the Ship Master who is typically the servant and agent of the Shipowner. If cargo is loaded on board a ship under a Charterparty (Contract of Carriage), the usual assumption is that the Shipper has contracted with the Shipowner. In the absence of any exceptional cases, the Shipper may assume that the Ship Master is the agent of the Shipowner. The Ship Master binds the Shipowner even if a form is utilized which is not authorized by the Charterparty (Contract of Carriage). If the Shipper does know the terms of the Charterparty (Contract of Carriage), the Shipper is or should be aware that to sign Bills of Lading (B/L) other than in the particular form is beyond the Ship Master’s authority, the Shipowner will not be liable to the Shipper but the Charterer will be liable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, primarily in the liner trade, Charterers issue their Bills of Lading (B/L), putting themselves forward as the contractual Carrier. In such cases, the Bills of Lading (B/L) Holder will have a choice as to whom to sue for damages to the cargo. In practice, the Bills of Lading (B/L) Holder will protect his interest against both Shipowners and the Charterers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bills of Lading’s (B/L) Important Clauses&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;hx-absolute -hx-mt-20&#34; id=&#34;bills-of-ladings-bl-important-clauses&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#bills-of-ladings-bl-important-clauses&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ship Operators have been pursuing to incorporate clauses into the Bills of Lading (B/L) that will give them as many rights and immunities as possible. In some cases, such clauses comprise the terms of carriage under which the cargo is carried on the Bills of Lading (B/L). Bills of Lading’s (B/L) Important Clauses are:-&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;**1- Lien Clause: **Lien Clause specifies that the Shipowner is entitled to a lien on the cargo in particular cases related to non-payment of the freight. This is a Contractual Lien. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2- Clause Paramount:&lt;/strong&gt; By Clause Paramount the Hague-Visby Rules may be incorporated within the terms of the Bills of Lading (B/L). Hague-Visby Rules are automatically incorporated into any Bills of Lading (B/L) that serve to evidence the contract of carriage and which is issued in respect of a port of shipment from the United Kingdom. Clause Paramount is crucial because unless expressly incorporated, the Hague-Visby Rules **do not **apply to Charterparties. Therefore, if a Bill of Lading (B/L) is issued under a Charterparty, the Charterparty will not be covered by the Hague-Visby Rules unless the Hague-Visby Rules are expressly incorporated into the Bill of Lading (B/L).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3- Voyage Clause:&lt;/strong&gt; Voyage Clause allows the ship to steam with or without pilots or tugs, to tow or to be towed, and to call at any port in any order both on and off the announced route, and to carry particular cargoes on deck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hague-Visby Rules (Article 1c) exclude live animals and goods carried on deck from the definition of goods to which the Hague-Visby Rules apply. Nevertheless, in consideration of cargo carried on deck, the exclusion is only effective where the contract of carriage expressly remarks that the goods are carried on deck. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a Voyage Clause that expressed that cargo may be carried on deck does not have the effect of excluding the Hague-Visby Rules. The Hague-Visby Rules may only be excluded by an Express Notification in the Bills of Lading (B/L) that the precise cargo is being carried on deck. Such a notification would serve as a forewarning to the Consignees (Endorsees) of the Bills of Lading (B/L) that the cargo was being shipped as Deck Cargo. Therefore, the Consignees (Endorsees) would have a total understanding of the facts when accepting the documents and would know that the carriage of the Deck Cargo was not subject to the obligations imposed on the Carrier by the Hague-Visby Rules. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the absence of Deck Cargo Express Notification in the Bills of Lading (B/L), the Consignees (Endorsees) of the Bills of Lading (B/L) would be entitled to presume that Hague-Visby Rules’ obligations were so imposed. A mere general liberty to carry cargo on deck is not a statement in the contract of carriage that the goods are being carried on deck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4- Himalaya Clause:&lt;/strong&gt; Himalaya Clause is incorporated into the Charter Parties (C/P) or Bills of Lading (B/L) to provide to servants, agents, subcontractors, etc. of the Carrier (Shipowner or Ship Operator) the advantages of all the exclusions and limitations enjoyed by the actual Carrier (Shipowner or Ship Operator) under the Bills of Lading (B/L) which protects them against Consignees (Endorsees) for claims in Contract or Tort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Adler Vs Dickson (The Himalaya) 1955 Case, Ship Master, and Bosun were held responsible for a passenger who fell due to incorrect rigging of the gang-plank. The injured passenger realized that she could not claim damages from the shipping line under the phrasing of the passenger ticket. The injured passenger successfully sued the Ship Master and the errant Bosun in Tort. Consequently, Shipowners incorporated a clause, expressed in the form of the Himalaya Clause, in all passenger tickets and Bills of Lading (B/L).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Incorporating a Himalaya Clause into a Bill of Lading (B/L) drafted under the Hague Visby Rules is redundant because a form of Himalaya Clause is contained in Article IV bis of the Hague Visby Rules&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the Carrier (Shipowner or Ship Operator) contracts as an agent for a Third Party, for instance, a Dockworker Company, the Third Party can enforce the terms of the Bill of Lading (B/L) against the Shipper:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a- If the Bill of Lading (B/L) explicitly states that the Dockworker Company is entitled to be protected by the provisions in the Bill of Lading (B/L) which limit liability&lt;br&gt;
b- If the Bill of Lading (B/L) explicitly states that the Carrier, in addition to contracting for these provisions on his behalf is also contracting as an agent for the Third Party (Dockworker Company) that those provisions should apply to the Third Party&lt;br&gt;
c- The Carrier has authority from the Third Party (Dockworker Company) to do that &lt;br&gt;
d- Any problems about consideration moving from the Third Party (Dockworker Company) would be overcome&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5- General Average (GA) Clause:&lt;/strong&gt; The Bill of Lading (B/L) expresses the fact that if General Average (GA) is to arise then the &lt;strong&gt;York-Antwerp Rules&lt;/strong&gt; should apply&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6- Transhipment Clause:&lt;/strong&gt; Transhipment Clause expresses the circumstances under which cargo must be transshipped. Transhipment Clause authorizes the Shipowner to undertake a voyage in this way and is a means of enabling the Shipowner to be exonerated from responsibility once the cargo has unloaded from the ship, even though the Shipowner has, under the terms of the Bill of Lading (B/L), undertaken to carry the cargo to the final destination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;**7- Salvage Clause: **Salvage Clause apply in circumstances where it may be necessary to salve a ship and/or a rowboat. Salvage Clause establishes that a **Salvage Award **should also be paid in cases where there is a sister ship salvage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8- Freight Clause:&lt;/strong&gt; The Freight Clause deals with the settlement of freight under the Bill of Lading (B/L).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;**What are the Types of Bills of Lading (B/L)? **&lt;span class=&#34;hx-absolute -hx-mt-20&#34; id=&#34;what-are-the-types-of-bills-of-lading-bl&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#what-are-the-types-of-bills-of-lading-bl&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1- Conventional Bills of Lading (B/L)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;hx-absolute -hx-mt-20&#34; id=&#34;1--conventionalbills-of-lading-bl&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#1--conventionalbills-of-lading-bl&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conventional Bills of Lading (B/L) are almost invariably Shipped of Lading (B/L). Conventional Bills of Lading (B/L) are issued for any cargo except that which is carried in a container. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conventional Bills of Lading (B/L) have been the basic document for general cargo for many years. Conventional Bills of Lading (B/L) are the backbone of any documentary Letter of Credit (L/C) transactions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ship’s Rail:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;hx-absolute -hx-mt-20&#34; id=&#34;ships-rail&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#ships-rail&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The basic legal point is that liability under such Conventional Bills of Lading (B/L) does not commence until the cargo passes the ship’s rail at the loading port and ceases immediately after the cargo passes the vessel’s rail at discharging port. This may cause some conflicts. For instance, cargo slipping out of the sling over the quayside. Cargo has not passed the ship’s rail therefore the Bills of Lading (B/L) requirements will not have come into play.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether or not the Dock Workers are sub-contractors to the Carrier (Shipowner or Ship Operator) may be a moot point. Commonly, the Dock Workers are employees of the terminal with whom the Shipper would have a particular agreement. On the other hand, the Stevedores (workers on the ship itself) are almost always servants of the Carrier (Shipowner or Ship Operator).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In another case, the Consignee was delayed in collecting the cargo which was left on the quayside after the vessel sailed. On collecting the cargo, the cargo was encountered to have suffered rain damage while lying on the quayside. No claim is practicable under the Bills of Lading (B/L) which ceased at the Ship’s Rail. There may conceivably be a claim against the Terminal Operator depending upon the contractual position. Possibly even a claim in Tort against the Ship Agent who had a duty of care towards the Cargo Owner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unless the Charterparty (Contract for Carriage) delivers for the Shipper to be responsible for the loading and discharging operations, the Carrier (Shipowner or Ship Operator) may be held liable for any cargo damage occurring before loading and/or the subsequent discharge while the cargo is in the Carrier’s possession. Under these circumstances, the Charterparty (Contract for Carriage) terms are presumably to contractually extend the Hague-Visby Rules to comprise these periods thereby giving the Carrier (Shipowner or Ship Operator) the benefit of the defenses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2- Received for Shipment Bills of Lading (B/L)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;hx-absolute -hx-mt-20&#34; id=&#34;2--received-for-shipment-bills-of-lading-bl&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#2--received-for-shipment-bills-of-lading-bl&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In some rare cases, Received for Shipment Bills of Lading (B/L) are issued. For instance, if there is congestion at the port, whereby cargo may be waiting for shipment on board a ship, the Carrier (Shipowner or Ship Operator) may issue Received for Shipment Bills of Lading (B/L) which means that the cargo has been handed over to the Carrier (Shipowner or Ship Operator) and is in the Carrier’s custody, but the cargo has not been loaded on board the ship. The cargo may be stowed in a storage or transit shed or even on the quayside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3- Shipped Bills of Lading (B/L)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;hx-absolute -hx-mt-20&#34; id=&#34;3--shipped-bills-of-lading-bl&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#3--shipped-bills-of-lading-bl&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the cargo is actually loaded on board the ship, Received for Shipment Bills of Lading (B/L) is changed with the &lt;strong&gt;Shipped Bills of Lading (B/L)&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UnderShipped Bills of Lading (B/L), the cargo is safely on board the ship in the custody of the Carrier (Shipowner or Ship Operator), under the Received for Shipment Bills of Lading (B/L) this is not so. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UnderReceived for Shipment Bills of Lading (B/L), the cargo is wide open to the risks of fire, pilferage, loss, or damage caused by the weather. Received for Shipment Bills of Lading (B/L) give no certainty to the safety of the cargo so far as the various parties to the contract of carriage may be concerned. In these cases, Received for Shipment Bills of Lading (B/L) do not evidence of actual shipment. It may be that the cargo is not actually loaded on board the named ship. There is suspicion as to the actual fulfillment of the Shippers’ legal obligations under the contract. Therefore, the Received for Shipment Bills of Lading (B/L) is not acceptable to banks in the transaction of global trade. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4- Through Bills of Lading (B/L)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;hx-absolute -hx-mt-20&#34; id=&#34;4--through-bills-of-lading-bl&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#4--through-bills-of-lading-bl&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Through Bills of Lading (B/L) are identical in formation and function to the Conventional Bills of Lading (B/L), except on the face of Through Bills of Lading (B/L), there are boxes for the name of a pre-carrier to be inserted together with the place of acceptance by the pre-carrier. Thereafter the standard port of loading and port of discharge is followed by the name of the on-carrier with space for showing the place of delivery by the on-carrier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through Bills of Lading (B/L) are suitable where the ocean carrier is remote from the place of origin and/or place of destination so that the cargo has to be fed to/from the loading/discharging port of the ocean carrier, generally by short-sea ships.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through Bills of Lading (B/L) should not be confused with** Combined Transport Bills of Lading (CT-B/L)**. The difference between Through Bills of Lading (B/L) and Combined Transport Bills of Lading (CT-B/L) is that, underThrough Bills of Lading (B/L), the &lt;strong&gt;Ocean Carrier acts as an Agent&lt;/strong&gt; for the Pre-Carrier or On-Carrier. UnderThrough Bills of Lading (B/L), &lt;strong&gt;Ocean Carrier&lt;/strong&gt; undertakes to make the arrangements and charges a single through shipping rate but &lt;strong&gt;Ocean Carrier’s liability is only for the ocean voyage&lt;/strong&gt;, claims arising through issues during pre-carriage or on-carriage have to be made to those parties &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5- Combined Transport Bills of Lading (CT-B/L)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;hx-absolute -hx-mt-20&#34; id=&#34;5--combined-transport-bills-of-ladingct-bl&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#5--combined-transport-bills-of-ladingct-bl&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Combined Transport Bills of Lading (CT-B/L) were practically designed to serve the container business. The face of the Combined Transport Bills of Lading (CT-B/L) is similar to the Through Bills of Lading (B/L) in having extra boxes for the place of receipt and place of delivery.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The essential difference between a Combined Transport Bills of Lading (CT-B/L) and a Through Bills of Lading (B/L) is that under the Combined Transport Bills of Lading (CT-B/L), &lt;strong&gt;the Carrier accepts liability for the Entire Carriage&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the container business, there may be pre-carriage or on-carriage by rail, barge, or truck and with the ocean carriers becoming ever larger, feeder container ships may be used to or from the hub ports. Combined Transport Bills of Lading (CT-B/L) have to deal with all these arrangements and the clauses on the back of the Combined Transport Bills of Lading (CT-B/L) are developed to facilitate these multiple transportations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One issue that has to be overcome is the variation in international agreements covering ocean carriage, rail carriage, and road haulage. Especially, the variations in international agreements affect &lt;strong&gt;Time-Bars&lt;/strong&gt; and limitations of &lt;strong&gt;Liability&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, Combined Transport Bills of Lading (CT-B/L) stipulates that if loss or damage is occurring whilst being transported by road the applicable convention will be the international convention &lt;strong&gt;CMR (Convention Relative au Contrat de Tranportation des Marchandises par vois de Routs).&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Combined Transport Bills of Lading (CT-B/L) stipulates that if loss or damage is occurring when crossing an international border by rail the applicable convention will be &lt;strong&gt;CIM (Convention Internationale concernant le transport de Marchandises par Chemin de Fer)&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In rare cases, Combined Transport Bills of Lading (CT-B/L) cover ocean carriage and air freight, the air transportation is governed by the** Warsaw Convention**.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These international conventions’ time-bar periods are much shorter than Hague-Visby Rules. These international conventions’ limitations of liability are different in quantum and procedures of calculation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, these international conventions only apply when the transportation is across an** international border** which means that if no border crossing is concerned then the rules applicable to the country concerned will apply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is important to keep in mind that if it is proved that damage was caused during the sea voyage, then the &lt;strong&gt;Hague-Visby Rules&lt;/strong&gt; apply. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;**Which c****onvention (regulation) applies if it cannot be established at which stage of the transportation the loss or damage took place?  **&lt;span class=&#34;hx-absolute -hx-mt-20&#34; id=&#34;which-convention-regulation-applies-if-it-cannot-be-established-at-which-stage-of-the-transportation-the-loss-or-damage-took-place&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#which-convention-regulation-applies-if-it-cannot-be-established-at-which-stage-of-the-transportation-the-loss-or-damage-took-place&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;Principally, most carriers stipulate that the claim must be brought under the &lt;strong&gt;Hague-Visby Rules&lt;/strong&gt;; other carriers stipulate an overriding procedure. Both the United Nations (UN) and the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) have drafted proposed international conventions on intermodalism to clarify this problem. However, to date, neither of these has gained adequate support to convince governments to ratify them.    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It can easily be noticed why the Carrier’s liability must commence sooner if the cargo passes into the Carrier’s hands somewhere inland but less easy to see why Combined Transport Bills of Lading (CT-B/L) is required when a Full Container Load (FCL) is booked from Port-to-Port (Quay-to-Quay). The point is that the Carrier requires full control of all the containers intended to be loaded to rearrange the containers near the dock before the container ship arrives so that the correct sequence of loading can be arranged. This procedure is called Container Ship Planning. Container Ship Planning depends not only on the port of discharge but also on the weight of the container as the heavier containers have to be stowed lower down in the container ship. Therefore,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quay-to-Quay Combined Transport Bills of Lading (CT-B/L) would show the place of receipt CY (Container Yard).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Shipper’s cargo pass to the Carrier’s custody before crossing the container ship’s rail is the rationale for the essential difference between Combined Transport Bills of Lading (CT-B/L) and other Bills of Lading (B/L).  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Combined Transport Bills of Lading (CT-B/L) are Received for Shipment Bills of Lading (B/L). Theoretically, the Shipper can request Received for Shipment Bills of Lading (B/L) as soon as the cargo passes into the Carrier’s control, which could even be at the manufacturer’s doors. Such requests are infrequently if ever, made in practice because the Shipper would then have to return the Received for Shipment Bills of Lading (B/L) to the Carrier to have it endorsed with the details of being shipped on board. Nevertheless, all Combined Transport Bills of Lading (CT-B/L) have to be endorsed on the face with confirmation of being shipped with the date of shipment and a signature by the Carrier or the Carrier’s Agent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Combined Transport Bills of Lading (CT-B/L) differ from most other Bills of Lading (B/L) because even if Combined Transport Bills of Lading (CT-B/L) are for a simple Door-to-Door movement, the Bills of Lading (B/L) are not spent when the cargo crosses the container ship’s rail at discharging port but remains in force until the cargo pass into the consignee’s control in the discharging port CY (Container Yard). Agreements beyond Door-to-Door stay in force until the cargo reach wherever it had been agreed that the agreement extends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Difficulties have materialized in this respect because some container operators offer consignees the option of declaring a change of place of inland destination. The Shipper may have initially consigned the container as a Port-to-Port shipment, therefore the destination would appear in the name of a discharging port CY (Container Yard). Under the option granted the Consignee could declare the decision within the stipulated time and could agree to pay the amount offered for the road haulage by the container operators, after which the container could be delivered to the Consignee’s location.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6- Sea Waybills&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;hx-absolute -hx-mt-20&#34; id=&#34;6--sea-waybills&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#6--sea-waybills&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sea Waybills are identical in many respects to Bills of Lading (B/L). However, there is one essential difference between Sea Waybills and Bills of Lading (B/L), &lt;strong&gt;Sea Waybills are Non-Negotiable&lt;/strong&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In many cases, the payment arrangements between buyer and seller do not require a Letter of Credit (L/C). Furthermore, the Consignee has no intention to sell the cargo during the voyage. All that is then needed is for the Sea Waybills to require the Carrier to deliver the goods to a Named Consignee after checking the Consignee’s Identity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sea Waybills do not have a Document of Title (DOT) function&lt;/strong&gt;. Not being a Document of Title there is no requirement to present Sea Waybills to the Carrier to claim the cargo. Therefore, all the difficulties of cargo arriving before the Bills of Lading (B/L) disappear. This qualifies electronic communication and Cargo Manifest can be transmitted by electronic means and preparations to arrange delivery when the time comes can be made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Originally, Sea Waybills did not give Consignees the same facility to sue the Carrier as was available with the Bills of Lading (B/L). However, this problem was corrected when the** Carriage of Goods by Sea Act 1992 ** replaced the &lt;strong&gt;Bill of Lading Act 1855&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7- House Bills of Lading (B/L)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;hx-absolute -hx-mt-20&#34; id=&#34;7--house-bills-of-lading-bl&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#7--house-bills-of-lading-bl&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Non-Vessel Operating Carriers (NVOCs) contract as the Carrier with the Shippers of individual cargoes and Non-Vessel Operating Carriers (NVOCs) contract with the Ocean Carrier as an FCL (Full Container Load) Shipper. Therefore, the Container Line issues a Bill of Lading (B/L) for the container with no precise reference to the container’s contents. The Container Line delivers the container to the Non-Vessel Operating Carrier’s (NVOC) Discharging Port Operating Partner. The Non-Vessel Operating Carrier (NVOC) issues the company’s Bill of Lading (B/L) to each consignor. Non-Vessel Operating Carrier’s (NVOC) Discharging Port Operating Partner is responsible for delivering the cargo to the respective consignees against the presentation of the appropriate Bill of Lading (B/L).  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shippers dealing directly with a Container Line should be satisfied as to the Container Line’s integrity, so must Shippers dealing with Non-Vessel Operating Carriers (NVOCs) make their assessments; especially regarding clauses dealing with Limitations of Liability. Fortunately, FIATA (International Federation of Freight Forwarders Associations) has done much to encourage the use of a standard form of House Bills of Lading (B/L).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;**Mate’s Receipt (MR) **&lt;span class=&#34;hx-absolute -hx-mt-20&#34; id=&#34;mates-receipt-mr&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#mates-receipt-mr&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bills of Lading (B/L) are concluded and signed sometime after the cargo has been loaded therefore the details at the moment of loading of **bulk (non-containerized) **cargo are documented in the form of a Mate’s Receipt (MR). Traditionally, Mate’s Receipt (MR) is prepared and issued by the &lt;strong&gt;Chief Officer (Chief Mate)&lt;/strong&gt; of a ship whose job is to check the correct receipt of the cargo loaded on board and to supervise the cargo stowage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mate’s Receipt (MR) indicates any discrepancies in the quantity or pre-shipment condition of the cargo. From the moment of issue of the Mate’s Receipt (MR), the Shipowner is in full possession of the cargo, and from that moment the Shipowner is responsible for the safety of that cargo per the pre-shipment condition of cargo as stipulated in the Mate’s Receipt (MR). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the cargo is loaded on board the Shipper can demand the issue of the Bills of Lading (B/L) and all essential data will be transferred from the Mate’s Receipt (MR) to the Bills of Lading (B/L) itself. Today, the Mate’s Receipt (MR) is a copy of the &lt;strong&gt;Shipping Note (Dock Receipt)&lt;/strong&gt; and the checking is carried out by Tally Clerks or Cargo Inspectors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neither the &lt;strong&gt;Mate’s Receipt (MR)&lt;/strong&gt; nor indeed the &lt;strong&gt;Shipping Note (Dock Receipt)&lt;/strong&gt; is in any way referred to as a Document of Title (DOT) and the information that is made therein is not conclusive evidence against the Ship Master or the Shipowner. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Missing Bill of Lading (B/L)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;hx-absolute -hx-mt-20&#34; id=&#34;missing-bill-of-lading-bl&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#missing-bill-of-lading-bl&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is typical for cargo to be available for collection by the Consignee but the Consignee is unable to do so because the Consignee has no Original Bill of Lading (B/L) to claim the consignment. The Carrier (Shipowner or Ship Operator) must deliver the cargo only to one who presents a valid Original Bill of Lading (B/L).  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Consignee may present a **Letter of Indemnity (LOI)**&lt;strong&gt;for Missing Bills of Lading (B/L).&lt;/strong&gt; Unlike letters of indemnity for Clean Bills of Lading (B/L), a Letter of Indemnity (LOI) for Missing Bills of Lading (B/L) is &lt;strong&gt;not fraudulent&lt;/strong&gt; but it does have its drawbacks.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, a Letter of Indemnity (LOI) for Missing Bills of Lading (B/L) has to be comprehensively dependable and this is performed by the letter being countersigned by a First-Class Bank.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secondly, a Letter of Indemnity (LOI) for Missing Bills of Lading (B/L) must be unqualified. Most banks are hesitant to issue unqualified letters because banks have no method of assessing the risk they are taking.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thirdly, it is pricey, banks charge substantially for accepting open-ended risks even though banks demand a counter-indemnity from the Consignee. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The concern is how long should the Letter of Indemnity (LOI) for Missing Bills of Lading (B/L) remain valid because the Carrier’s (Shipowner or Ship Operator) absolute obligation to deliver cargo against the Original Bills of Lading (B/L) means that delivery to the wrong party becomes the Tort of Conversion which would leave the Tortfeasor liable for the whole value of the consignment. In most cases, this problem is solved when the Original Bills of Lading (B/L) eventually is received and the Original Bills of Lading (B/L) are then exchanged for the Letter of Indemnity (LOI) which is duly canceled thus extinguishing the bank’s liability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Irrevocably Lost Bill of Lading (B/L)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;hx-absolute -hx-mt-20&#34; id=&#34;irrevocably-lost-bill-of-lading-bl&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#irrevocably-lost-bill-of-lading-bl&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In some rare cases, when the Bills of Lading (B/L) have become irrevocably lost and the statute of limitations for the tort of conversion is six (6) years. Nevertheless, it is seldom, if ever that a Carrier (Shipowner or Ship Operator) demands the Letter of Indemnity (LOI) remain valid for all that time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prudent Ship Agents obtain the Principal’s agreement to accept a Letter of Indemnity (LOI) for Missing Bills of Lading (B/L) because there is &lt;strong&gt;no protection from the Himalaya Clause&lt;/strong&gt; for Tort of Conversion. Therefore, if the Ship Agent accepts a Letter of Indemnity (LOI) without reference to the Principal and things go wrong, it is the Ship Agent who will face the claim in Tort.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Electronic Bill of Lading (B/L)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;hx-absolute -hx-mt-20&#34; id=&#34;electronic-bill-of-lading-bl&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#electronic-bill-of-lading-bl&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The more instantaneous shipment of cargo means that the possibilities are continually increasing for the cargo arriving well before the Bills of Lading (B/L) have worked their way through the banking system. Many initiatives are striving to solve this issue by the use of Electronic Bills of Lading (B/L) alternative to traditional Paper Bills of Lading (B/L). Today, it is possible for a Shipper to receive all the information it needs via the internet or telephone lines. Furthermore, most combined transport operators process cargo arrangements via the internet. A Shipowner could give irrevocable instructions to a Carrier to hold cargo for the disposition of a Named Consignee, who would then be entitled to receive the cargo at the port of destination exclusively based on the instruction and without the necessity to produce any document. Security is accomplished by issuing to each consignee a unique Private Key putting the holder in the same position as if the Consignee had possession of the Original Bills of Lading (B/L). The significant issue still rests with the use of Letters of Credit (L/C) and the need to authorize selling cargo on without any loss of security. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Three Original Bills of Lading (B/L)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;hx-absolute -hx-mt-20&#34; id=&#34;three-originalbills-of-lading-bl&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#three-originalbills-of-lading-bl&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Generally, Shippers require three (3) Original Bills of Lading (B/L). In this case, if any one of the Original Bills of Lading (B/L) is being accomplished the others shall be void. The Letter of Credit (L/C) requires all three (3) Original Bills of Lading (B/L) before paying out because banks would not have security for payment if one of the Original Bills of Lading (B/L) is other than in the bank’s possession.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;History of Three Original Bills of Lading (B/L)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;hx-absolute -hx-mt-20&#34; id=&#34;history-of-three-originalbills-of-lading-bl&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#history-of-three-originalbills-of-lading-bl&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;A manuscript written in 1686 (Malnes Les Mercantoria) commented: “of the Bills of Lading (B/L) there is customarily three Bills of one tenor. One of them is enclosed in the letters carried by the same ship; another Bill is sent overland to the Factor or Party to whom the goods are consigned; the third remaineth with the Merchant, for his testimony against the Ship Master if there were any occasion or loose dealing”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1934, Lord Blackburn wrote: “I have never been able to learn why merchants and shipowners continue the practice of making out a Bill of Lading (B/L) in parts. I should have thought that every purpose would be answered by making out one Bill of Lading (B/L) only which should be the sole Document of Title”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, traditionally, the banks resume directing to a “full set of three (3) shipped on board Bills of Lading (B/L)”. Therefore, all three (3) Original Bills of Lading (B/L) have to be presented when negotiating the Letter of Credit (L/C). Old traditions die hard in the shipping business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hague-Visby Rules and Bill of Lading (B/L)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;hx-absolute -hx-mt-20&#34; id=&#34;hague-visby-rules-and-bill-of-lading-bl&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#hague-visby-rules-and-bill-of-lading-bl&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;At beginning of the 19th century, many complicated negligence clauses were incorporated by Shipowners into their Bills of Lading (B/L). These negligence clauses were drafted completely to defeat the effect of legal decisions against the Shipowners. Many of these clauses were drafted in an exceptionally ambiguous tone and were quite incomprehensible to interpret, as a result, the position of many Charterers, Shippers, Bankers, and Cargo Underwriters became ludicrous because they were unable to comprehend and interpret the extent of their rights against the Carrier (Shipowner or Ship Operator) in the carriage of cargo by sea. Therefore, a uniform international approach to all Bills of Lading (B/L) was needed, to reconcile the interests of all parties involved in the carriage of cargo by sea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1893, the United States of America (USA) passed the &lt;strong&gt;Harter Act&lt;/strong&gt;. Harter Act stipulated many conditions upon which cargoes were shipped to and from the United States of America (USA). Identical legislation was introduced by other governments to correct this unfair situation, such as Australia, which developed its Sea Carriage of Goods Act 1904, and Canada which passed The Water Carriage of Goods Act 1910.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1921, a set of regulations was drafted by the Maritime Law Committee of the International Law Association at a meeting at the Hague. These draft rules, subsequently known as the &lt;strong&gt;Hague Rules&lt;/strong&gt; were the subject of negotiation and amendment which culminated in their being incorporated in an International Convention that was signed in Brussels on 25th August 1924 by the major trading governments. Most of the participating governments introduced laws to give effect to the Hague Rules. Therefore, the United Kingdom enacted the &lt;strong&gt;Carriage of Goods by Sea Act 1924&lt;/strong&gt;. The introduction of containerization created dissatisfaction with the limitations of the Hague Rules. Hague Rules were amended by The Brussels Protocol of 1968 and became known as the &lt;strong&gt;Hague-Visby Rules&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The preponderance of the maritime governments ratified the Hague-Visby Rules. To give effect to the Hague-Visby Rules, the United Kingdom enacted the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act 1971. &lt;strong&gt;Carriage of Goods by Sea Act 1971&lt;/strong&gt; repeals the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act 1924 entirety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hague-Visby Rules&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;hx-absolute -hx-mt-20&#34; id=&#34;hague-visby-rules&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#hague-visby-rules&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Hague-Visby Rules apply to all contracts of carriage which are evidenced by a **Bills of Lading (B/L) **or a similar **Document of Title (DOT) **where:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a- Bill of Lading (B/L) is issued in the United Kingdom, or,&lt;br&gt;
b- Shipment from a port within the United Kingdom&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the Hague-Visby Rules apply to other such contracts of carriage evidenced by a Bill of Lading (B/L) if &lt;strong&gt;expressly incorporated&lt;/strong&gt;. Therefore, even if the port of shipment is from a nation that has not incorporated the Hague-Visby Rules into its legislation, the Hague-Visby Rules are applicable if the Hague-Visby Rules are **expressly incorporated **in the Bill of Lading (B/L).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;**The Hague-Visby Rules particularly refer to Bills of Lading (B/L) or other Documents of Title (DOT). The Hague-Visby Rules do not apply to Charterparties.  **&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, if a Bill of Lading (B/L) is issued in respect of a ship under a Charterparty, the Hague-Visby Rules will apply to the contract evidence by the Bill of Lading (B/L). Therefore, if a Bill of Lading (B/L) is issued to a Charterer within the Charterparty as **evidence **or **receipt **only for the cargo, &lt;strong&gt;the Hague-Visby Rules are not applicable&lt;/strong&gt;. However, if the Charterer endorses that Bill of Lading (B/L) in favor of an Endorsee, the Hague-Visby Rules will then govern the relationship between the Charterer and the Endorsee and are applicable from the point of endorsement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clause Paramount&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;hx-absolute -hx-mt-20&#34; id=&#34;clause-paramount&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#clause-paramount&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The parties to a Charterparty may stipulate that all Bills of Lading (B/L) issued under it shall be governed by the &lt;strong&gt;Hague-Visby Rules (Clause Paramount)&lt;/strong&gt; therefore the Hague-Visby Rules will apply even if the shipment does not originate from a country that has adopted the Hague-Visby Rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;**Hague-Visby Rules and Sea Waybills **&lt;span class=&#34;hx-absolute -hx-mt-20&#34; id=&#34;hague-visby-rules-and-sea-waybills&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#hague-visby-rules-and-sea-waybills&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The expression Contract of Carriage applies only to Contracts of Carriage governed by a Bill of Lading (B/L) or similar Documents of Title (DOT). A &lt;strong&gt;Non-Negotiable Receipt&lt;/strong&gt; will not necessarily be a Bill of Lading (B/L). Therefore, Sea Waybills expressly stipulate that the Hague-Visby Rules will apply. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The phrase &lt;strong&gt;Carrier&lt;/strong&gt; as used in the Hague-Visby Rules indicates either the &lt;strong&gt;Shipowner&lt;/strong&gt; or the &lt;strong&gt;Time Charterer&lt;/strong&gt; who contracts with the Shipper. Therefore, the Carrier can be sued by the &lt;strong&gt;Bills of Lading (B/L) Holder&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hague-Visby Rules** do not** apply to carriage or storage before the port of loading or after the port of discharge because that would be inland and not sea carriage. However, if the cargo is discharged and stored at an intermediate port before transshipment to another ship, the Hague-Visby Rules apply during the period of storage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carrier (Shipowner or Ship Operator) is entitled to enter into any contract stipulation condition reservation or exemption as to the responsibility and liability of the Carrier (Shipowner or Ship Operator) or the ship for loss of or damage to or in connection with the custody and care and handling of the cargo before the loading on and after the discharge from, the ship on which the cargo is carried by sea. Once the Hague-Visby Rules apply the parties may not change their provisions by contract save in respect of deleting excepted perils or increasing the limit of liability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Functions of the Hague-Visby Rules&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;hx-absolute -hx-mt-20&#34; id=&#34;functions-of-the-hague-visby-rules&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#functions-of-the-hague-visby-rules&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A- Hague-Visby Rules set out the &lt;strong&gt;obligations&lt;/strong&gt; of both parties (Carrier and Shipper), especially the Carrier (Shipowner or Ship Operator) for whom Hague-Visby Rules list the minimum statutory requirements imposed upon the Carrier (Shipowner or Ship Operator) in the undertaking of international business.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;B- Hague-Visby Rules set out where a Carrier (Shipowner or Ship Operator) &lt;strong&gt;may exempt himself from liability&lt;/strong&gt; as a consequence of one of the exceptions embodied in the Hague-Visby Rules. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;C- Hague-Visby Rules define the &lt;strong&gt;limits of the Carrier’s (Shipowner or Ship Operator) liability&lt;/strong&gt;. The shipper should not consider the Carrier (Shipowner or Ship Operator) as the insurer of his cargo. A prudent Shipper would cover himself from loss or damage to the cargo by taking out an all-risks policy. Any claim to be pursued against the Carrier (Shipowner or Ship Operator) would then be undertaken by the Cargo Insurers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Important Parts of the Hague-Visby Rules&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;hx-absolute -hx-mt-20&#34; id=&#34;important-parts-of-the-hague-visby-rules&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#important-parts-of-the-hague-visby-rules&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;**Hague-Visby Rules Article I:  **Specifies the definitions of the phrase Carrier and Contract of Carriage. Hague-Visby Rules apply exclusively to Contracts of Carriage covered by a Bill of Lading (B/L). Hague-Visby Rules clarify the position of Bill of Lading (B/L) issued under a Charterparty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hague-Visby Rules Article I Rule (1c):&lt;/strong&gt; Hague-Visby Rules do not cover live animals. Furthermore, Hague-Visby Rules do not cover deck cargo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To avoid liability the Bills of Lading (B/L) must undoubtedly remark “loaded on deck at shipper’s risk”. If the cargo is loaded on deck but this is not stated on the Bills of Lading (B/L), the full force of the Hague-Visby Rules will apply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;**Hague-Visby Rules Article III Rule (1): **Before the Hague-Visby Rules were introduced the situation was that in every contract of carriage by sea there was implied an absolute warranty of seaworthiness throughout the sea voyage. The Hague-Visby Rules require that the Shipowners shall &lt;strong&gt;exercise due diligence&lt;/strong&gt; to make the ship seaworthy &lt;strong&gt;before and at the beginning of the sea voyage&lt;/strong&gt;. Furthermore, The Hague-Visby Rules require that the Shipowners shall properly man and equip the ship and also make the holds &lt;strong&gt;cargoworthy&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The phrase &lt;strong&gt;exercise due diligence&lt;/strong&gt; may not be taken lightly, it is a personal obligation upon the Shipowner and may be considered &lt;strong&gt;a duty of care&lt;/strong&gt;. Shipowners’ duty of care cannot be delegated. Shipowners cannot abdicate their responsibility to a third party.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Riverstone Meat Co. v. Lancashire Shipping Co. Case 1961, Riverstone Meat Co. (Plaintiff) contracted with the Lancashire Shipping Co. (Defendant) to ship 150 cases of canned ox tongue from Sydney to London aboard Lancashire Shipping’s controlled MV Muncaster Castle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cargo was damaged by seawater. Some months earlier the MV Muncaster Castle underwent a load line survey which was carried out by a reputable firm of surveyors under the supervision of Lloyds Register (LR). After the survey the inspection covers on the storm valves had not been properly tightened by the fitter, therefore, seawater was allowed to enter the hold. The case went all the way to the House of Lords where Lord Radcliffe, in concurring with the judgment against the shipowner Lancashire Shipping Co. (Defendant) made the practical point that it would not make sense for the Riverstone Meat Co. (Plaintiff) to go chasing after contractors and sub-contractors working for the shipowner Lancashire Shipping Co. (Defendant), it was up to the shipowner Lancashire Shipping Co. (Defendant) to cover himself by obtaining satisfactory indemnities from those doing work for the shipowner. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hague-Visby Rules demand that if the shipowner has provided an appropriately qualified crew of appropriate size at the beginning of the sea voyage, the shipowner has fulfilled his obligation even if the crew’s subsequent incompetence causes issues to arise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hague-Visby Rules Article III Rule 2:&lt;/strong&gt; Requires the Carrier (Shipowner or Ship Operator) to look after the cargo properly. Hague-Visby Rules Article III Rule 2 draws attention to Article IV (exceptions) this is a continuous obligation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hague-Visby Rules Article III Rule 3****and Rule 4:&lt;/strong&gt; Specify the requirement to issue a Bill of Lading (B/L). Bill of Lading (B/L) must indicate the quantity, and apparent condition of the cargo as well as how the cargo can be efficiently identified. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hague-Visby Rules Article III Rule 5:&lt;/strong&gt; Specifies obligations upon the Shipper to guarantee the accuracy of the cargo details supplied. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hague-Visby Rules Article III Rule 6:&lt;/strong&gt; Specify the time bar. Hague-Visby Rules Article III Rule 6 notes that any loss or damage has to be notified within three (3) days of taking delivery of the cargo. Hague-Visby Rules Article III Rule 6 stipulates that the “ship will be discharged from all liability unless suit is brought within one (1) year”. The phrase “suit is brought” goes beyond merely claiming writing, court action has to be started. Hague-Visby Rules Article III Rule 6 provides for the parties to extend the time limit by mutual agreement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hague-Visby Rules Article III Rule 6bis:&lt;/strong&gt; Authorizes the Carrier to commence an action for indemnity against a third party even after the one-year time limit provided for in the preceding paragraph if brought within the time allowed by the law of the court seized with the case. Nevertheless, the time allowed shall not be less than three (3) months, starting from the day when the person bringing such an action for indemnity has settled the claim or has been served with process in the action against himself. This addition to Hague-Visby Rules Article III Rule 6 was added to overcome the issues experienced by Carriers who sub-contract all or part of the carriage but remain principally liable to the trader for the performance of the contract because of the absence of any demise clause in the Bill of Lading (B/L). If a claim is made or court action is commenced against such a Carrier at the last minute the Carrier would otherwise have little or no time within which to protect his right of recourse against the sub-contracting Carrier. The addition gives the main Carrier at least three (3) months in which the main Carrier can either settle the claim by amicable agreement or proceed against the sub-contractor. Hague-Visby Rules Article III Rule 6bis can be useful in the case of a container carrier using a Combined Transport Bill of Lading (B/L) where the loss or damage is caused by a feeder ship       &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hague-Visby Rules Article****IV Rule 1:&lt;/strong&gt; Reiterates the due diligence requirement and this is followed by the various exceptions included in Hague-Visby Rules Article IV Rule 2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hague-Visby Rules Article IV Rule 2a is an important exception that covers acts of negligence or default by those employed by the Shipowner in the navigation or management of the ship. Hague-Visby Rules Article IV Rule 2a emphasizes that the shipowner delivers officers and crew of correct numbers and properly qualified, if their acts or omissions cause damage to the cargo, the shipowner is not liable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hague-Visby Rules Article****IV Rule 3:&lt;/strong&gt; Provides the Shipper some degree of similar protection for their errors and omissions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;**Hague-Visby Rules Article****IV Rule 4: **Deviation Clause which goes beyond the Common Law restrictions. Hague-Visby Rules Article IV Rule 4 allows deviation to save property as well as life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hague-Visby Rules Article****IV Rule 5:&lt;/strong&gt; Specify the significant financial limitations of liability based on Special Drawing Rights (SDRs) which is a unit of account devised by the International Monetary Fund (IMF). The rate of exchange of any currency can be established against Special Drawing Rights (SDRs). The financial limitation payments are 666,67 units of account per package or 2 units of account per kilo whichever is the highest. Issues have arisen as to what includes a package when a sealed FCL (Full Container Load) is involved. The Carrier has no way of verifying how many individual items are in the container which is why care is taken to include the terms &lt;strong&gt;Said to Contain&lt;/strong&gt; when drafting Bills of Lading (B/L) for FCL (Full Container Load) containers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hague-Visby Rules Article&lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;IV Rule&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;5(a):&lt;/strong&gt; Allows for the minimum level of limitation to be increased above that provided by the Shipper expressly declaring a higher value before shipment and ensuring this is inserted in the Bills of Lading (B/L).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hague-Visby Rules Article&lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;IV Rule&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;6:&lt;/strong&gt; Highlights the Carrier’s right to deal with undeclared dangerous cargo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hague-Visby Rules Article****IV bis:&lt;/strong&gt; Stipulates Himalaya Clause and provides servants or agents of the Carrier the same protection and limitations as in the contract should a claim be made against them in tort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hague-Visby Rules Article****V:&lt;/strong&gt; Ensures that the Hague-Visby Rules do not prevent the insertion of any provision about the General Average (GA).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hague-Visby Rules Article****VI:&lt;/strong&gt; Allows the Hague-Visby Rules to be incorporated into documents that are not the Bills of Lading (B/L) such as Sea Waybills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hague-Visby Rules Article VII:&lt;/strong&gt; Allows the Hague-Visby Rules to be extended to care or handling of the cargo before and/or after carriage by sea. Hague-Visby Rules Article VII is an important rule in the container business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hague-Visby Rules Article&lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;VIII and Article&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;IX:&lt;/strong&gt; Deal with the Hague-Visby Rules not affecting rights and obligations under statutes in force and do not affect compliance with any international agreement concerning nuclear damage.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hague-Visby Rules Article****X:&lt;/strong&gt; Expresses that Hague-Visby Rules apply to contract states and any contract when the parties choose to incorporate the Hague-Visby Rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hague-Visby Rules solely apply if the Bills of Lading (B/L) are issued in a contracting state or the carriage is from a port in a contracting state. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;**Hamburg Rules and Bill of Lading (B/L) **&lt;span class=&#34;hx-absolute -hx-mt-20&#34; id=&#34;hamburg-rules-and-bill-of-lading-bl&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#hamburg-rules-and-bill-of-lading-bl&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1978, UNCTAD (United Nations Conference on Trade and Development) drafted a convention entitled Hamburg Rules. Hamburg Rules came into effect on 1st November 1992 which was the date when Hamburg Rules achieved ratification by its twentieth countries; none of the signatories is a prominent maritime nation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hamburg Rules mark topics in the Hague-Visby Rules which, in the drafters’ views, are least favorable to cargo-owning nations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is the difference between Hague Visby Rules and Hamburg Rules?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;hx-absolute -hx-mt-20&#34; id=&#34;what-is-the-difference-between-hague-visby-rules-and-hamburg-rules&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#what-is-the-difference-between-hague-visby-rules-and-hamburg-rules&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The difference between Hamburg Rules and Hague-Visby Rules is that&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hamburg Rules apply to any contract of carriage by sea against payment of freight except a Charterparty. Unlike Hague-Visby Rules, there is no question of restricting Hamburg Rules to Bills of Lading (B/L).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next significant difference is that the Hamburg Rules apply whether the cargo is loaded or discharged in a contracting nation. If the cargo is loaded in a Hague-Visby Rules nation, the Shippers expect Hague-Visby Rules to apply but if the destination is in a Hamburg Rules nation, the Receivers may insist on their Hamburg Rules with cargo claims arising at the discharging port.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, Hamburg Rules sweep aside most exceptions in Hague-Visby Rules. Hamburg Rules mandate the Carrier to prove that the Carrier took all measures to prevent loss or damage to the cargo. In practice, most of the exceptions in the Hague-Visby Rules are beyond the control of the Carrier so Hamburg Rules appear not harsh except that the Hamburg Rules introduce liability for delay. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The financial limits of liability that the Hamburg Rules introduced are higher than Hague-Visby Rules. Hamburg Rules stipulate 835 units of account per package or 2.3 units of account per kilo. Furthermore, Hamburg Rules stipulate two and a half times the freight in the case of delay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neither Deck Cargo nor Animals are excluded from the Hamburg Rules although the Carrier is not liable for special risks in the case of animals&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other significant change from Hague-Visby Rules is that the time bar under Hamburg Rules is two (2) years rather than one (1) year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hague-Visby Rules have been tested in the courts for many years. Therefore, there is a general objection to the Hamburg Rules by the maritime nations. Much of the wording in the Hamburg Rules is indicative of diplomatic compromise rather than legal consideration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, there is a widespread sentiment that the Hague-Visby Rules require an additional amendment to bring the Hague-Visby Rules into line with modern shipping requirements and concerns. Currently, only five percent (5%) of global trade is represented under Hamburg Rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Carriage of Goods by Sea Act 1992&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;hx-absolute -hx-mt-20&#34; id=&#34;carriage-ofgoods-by-sea-act-1992&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#carriage-ofgoods-by-sea-act-1992&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the United Kingdom, the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act 1971 is the ratification of the Hague-Visby Rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act 1992 is the Act that replaces the United Kingdom Bills of Lading Act 1855. The Carriage of Goods by Sea Act 1992 does not replace the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act 1971 Act. Many practitioners in the shipping business think that a less confusing title could have been found for the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act 1992. Furthermore, the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act 1992 covers documents other than Bills of Lading (B/L) such as Sea Waybills. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Carriage of Goods by Sea Act 1992 is the Act that replaces the United Kingdom Bills of Lading Act 1855. Other countries have their legislation covering Bills of Lading (B/L).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bills of Lading Act 1855&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;hx-absolute -hx-mt-20&#34; id=&#34;bills-of-lading-act-1855&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#bills-of-lading-act-1855&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bills of Lading Act 1855 was overdue for emendation because the Bills of Lading Act 1855 had certain drawbacks when the Bills of Lading (B/L) were transferred. Furthermore, the Bills of Lading Act 1855 could not cope with some present-day procedures. Nevertheless, for many years the Bills of Lading Act 1855 stood the test of time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Assignment of Contracts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;hx-absolute -hx-mt-20&#34; id=&#34;assignment-of-contracts&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#assignment-of-contracts&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;An assignment is a device that allows one party (Assignor) to transfer the benefit of a performance that one party (Assignor) has contracted to receive to another person in such a way that the Assignee may enforce performance. In this case, the original contract does not stipulate that the benefit of performance should go to a third party. An** involuntary assignment **by operation of law may occur upon death or bankruptcy. Nevertheless, the common law initially made no provision for the &lt;strong&gt;voluntary assignment&lt;/strong&gt; of contracts. The doctrine of privity prevents an individual who is not a party to the contract from suing upon that contract.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Assignment of Contract of Carriage (Charterparty)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;hx-absolute -hx-mt-20&#34; id=&#34;assignment-of-contract-of-carriage-charterparty&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#assignment-of-contract-of-carriage-charterparty&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before the Bills of Lading Act 1855, Under Common Law, when a Bill of Lading (B/L) was issued and passed to the Consignee with the explicit intention of passing the property in the cargo, it did not transfer the rights and liabilities under the contract of carriage to the Consignee. Practically, this would cause a significant problem as the Consignee would have no contractual recourse against the Carrier (Shipowner or Ship Operator) if the cargo was damaged or delayed. The Bills of Lading Act 1855 altered this issue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bills of Lading Act 1855 Section 1:&lt;/strong&gt; stipulates that when property in the cargo passes upon or because of an endorsement, the contractual rights of suit and contractual liabilities are transferred to the Endorsee. Bills of Lading (B/L) may only be transferred to another party if Bills of Lading (B/L) is drafted &lt;strong&gt;To Order&lt;/strong&gt; and so that the property in cargo may pass by assignment of the Bills of Lading (B/L), the subsequent prerequisites must be fulfilled: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1- The cargo must be in transit&lt;br&gt;
2- The Bills of Lading (B/L) must be transferable on the face of it&lt;br&gt;
3- The Bills of Lading (B/L) must have been put in circulation by someone who had a good title to the cargo&lt;br&gt;
4- There must have been an intention to transfer the property&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sheer endorsement and delivery of Bills of Lading (B/L) by way of deposit, for instance to a bank in a Letter of Credit (L/C) transaction, did not pass the property in the cargo to an Endorsee to make the Endorsee liable on the contract in the Bills of Lading (B/L). For the Bills of Lading Act 1855 to apply it is not necessary for the property in the cargo to pass at the same time as the endorsement of the Bills of Lading (B/L). If the contemporaneous transfer of property and the Bills of Lading (B/L) were required then the Bills of Lading Act 1855 would be rendered useless in a considerable number of cases where the contract of sale stipulates the point at which property in the cargo to pass which moment may well be one other than the time of transfer of the Bills of Lading (B/L). When the Shipper retained the proprietary right in the cargo, the Shipper would also retain the rights of suit against the Shipowner under the contract in the Bills of Lading (B/L). In this case, the Bills of Lading Act 1855 could barely be construed as intending to take those rights from the Shipper and transfer them to the Endorsee, in this case, the bankers. If the proprietary rights and the rights of the suit are not transferred, neither would the liabilities under the contract.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bills of Lading Act 1855 Section 2:&lt;/strong&gt; stipulates the right of the Shipowner to claim freight from the actual Shipper although the Bills of Lading (B/L) may have been assigned by him. Furthermore, Bills of Lading Act 1855 Section 2 preserves the right of the actual Shipper to stop the cargo in transit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bills of Lading Act 1855 Section 3:&lt;/strong&gt; stipulates that in the hands of the Consignee, the Bills of Lading (B/L) is definitive evidence of shipment as against the Ship Master or Ship Agent signing the Bills of Lading (B/L).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the functions of the Bills of Lading (B/L) is to act as a &lt;strong&gt;Receipt&lt;/strong&gt; for the cargo shipped. At Common Law, the Bills of Lading (B/L) are regarded as being &lt;strong&gt;Prima Facie&lt;/strong&gt; evidence that the quantity of cargo alleged to have been shipped has been shipped. Nevertheless, the Shipowner is entitled to prove that the cargo was never shipped. If the Shipowner proves that, the Shipowner will escape liability in respect of the cargo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prima Facie evidence is evidence at first sight only, which may be disputed by the party against whom the evidence is offered. In Grant v Norway (1851) Case, a Bill of Lading (B/L) was signed by the Ship Master for twelve (12) bales of silk, which the Shipowner proved had not been loaded on board. It was held that the Ship Master had no authority to sign for cargo not shipped and the Bill of Lading (B/L) Holder had no claim against the Shipowner for non-delivery of these bales&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bills of Lading Act 1855 Section 3 stipulates that the Bills of Lading (B/L) should be conclusive evidence that the cargo represented to have been shipped was in fact shipped. Bills of Lading Act 1855 Section 3 does not create actual liability on the part of the person who signed the Bills of Lading (B/L) if the cargo was in fact not shipped. Therefore, the ability of the Consignee and the Endorsee, to sue on the contract of carriage, was dependent upon the property in the cargo being vested in them upon the transfer of the Bills of Lading (B/L). Consequently, the Bills of Lading Act 1855 formed a marriage between entitlement to sue on the Bills of Lading (B/L) contract and property in the cargo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Aliakmon (1986) Case, the cargo of steel suffered damage due to inappropriate stowage. At that moment, the risk but not the actual property had passed to the CIF Buyer (Cost, Freight, Insurance). As there was no privity of contract between the CIF Buyer and the Carrier, the CIF Buyer could not sue under contract and therefore tried to sue under tort. The case failed because it was held that the Carrier had no duty of care towards the CIF Buyer as the CIF Buyer was not the owner of the cargo at the moment of the alleged negligence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Carriage of Goods by Sea Act 1992&lt;/strong&gt; divorces the ‘marriage formed by the Bills of Lading Act 1855 between property in the cargo and right to sue on the contract of carriage. Under the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act 1992, the lawful Bill of Lading (B/L) Holder (Section 2 (1) (a)) or the person to whom the goods are to be delivered under a Sea Waybill (Section 2 (1) (b)) (who was excluded from the ambit of Section 1 of the Bills of Lading Act 1855) or the person to whom the goods are to be delivered under a ship’s delivery order (Section 2 (1) (c)) can sue on the contract of carriage as if he had been a party to that contract.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carriage of Goods by Sea Act 1992 stipulates that with the current speed of ships, it is not unusual for the cargo to be correctly delivered against a Letter of Indemnity (LOI). In this case, at the time of delivery, the Consignee is not in actual possession of the Bill of Lading (B/L), and by the time the Bill of Lading (B/L) reaches the Consignee, Bill of Lading (B/L) will have ceased to be a Document of Title (DOT) because the cargo will no longer be in transit.     &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carriage of Goods by Sea Act 1992 separates the title to sue from the passing of the property in the cargo; lawful possession of the Bill of Lading (B/L) is sufficient. Even actual possession is not necessary provided that the measures taken to transfer the Bill of Lading (B/L) were made before the Bill of Lading (B/L) ceased to be a Document of Title (DOT).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carriage of Goods by Sea Act 1992, after listing the Bill of Lading (B/L) Holder or the person to whom delivery is to be made under a Sea Waybill or ship delivery order then stipulates “shall have transferred to and vested in him all rights of suit under the contract of carriage as if he had been a party to that contract” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act 1992, with rights come liabilities, and the person who demands delivery under a Bill of Lading (B/L), Sea Waybill, or Ship Delivery Order becomes subject to the same liabilities as the original Shipper which may possess obligations to pay the freight, demurrage, etc. These liabilities are not imposed on a party who merely holds the Bill of Lading (B/L) as security for payment, such as a bank.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act 1992, a Bill of Lading (B/L) is deemed conclusive evidence of such shipment against the Carrier which appears to overrule the Grant V Norway (1851) Case. &lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Break Even Point</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/docs/parta/marecofin/breakeven/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>
        
        
        &lt;p&gt;A firm reaches the &lt;strong&gt;break-even point (BEP)&lt;/strong&gt; when its &lt;strong&gt;total revenues equal total costs&lt;/strong&gt;, meaning it is neither making a profit nor incurring a loss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;🎯 &lt;strong&gt;Definition: Break-Even Point (BEP)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;hx-absolute -hx-mt-20&#34; id=&#34;-definition-break-even-point-bep&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#-definition-break-even-point-bep&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;break-even point&lt;/strong&gt; is the level of output or sales at which a business&amp;rsquo;s &lt;strong&gt;total revenue equals total costs&lt;/strong&gt; (fixed + variable). At this point, the firm covers all its expenses but earns &lt;strong&gt;zero profit&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;📈 When Does a Firm Reach Break-Even Point?&lt;span class=&#34;hx-absolute -hx-mt-20&#34; id=&#34;-when-does-a-firm-reach-break-even-point&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#-when-does-a-firm-reach-break-even-point&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A firm reaches break-even when:&lt;/p&gt;
$$
\textbf{Total Revenue} = \textbf{Total Costs}
$$&lt;p&gt;Where:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Total Revenue&lt;/strong&gt; = Selling price per unit × Number of units sold&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Total Costs&lt;/strong&gt; = Fixed Costs + Variable Costs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;🔢 How to Calculate Break-Even Point&lt;span class=&#34;hx-absolute -hx-mt-20&#34; id=&#34;-how-to-calculate-break-even-point&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#-how-to-calculate-break-even-point&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are two common ways to calculate the break-even point:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;1. &lt;strong&gt;Break-Even Quantity (Units)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;hx-absolute -hx-mt-20&#34; id=&#34;1-break-even-quantity-units&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#1-break-even-quantity-units&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;$$
\text{Break-Even Quantity} = \frac{\text{Fixed Costs}}{\text{Selling Price per Unit} - \text{Variable Cost per Unit}}
$$&lt;p&gt;This tells you how many units must be sold to cover all costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;2. &lt;strong&gt;Break-Even Sales (Monetary Value)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;hx-absolute -hx-mt-20&#34; id=&#34;2-break-even-sales-monetary-value&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#2-break-even-sales-monetary-value&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;$$
\text{Break-Even Sales} = \frac{\text{Fixed Costs}}{\text{Contribution Margin Ratio}}
$$&lt;p&gt;
Where:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Contribution Margin Ratio = $\frac{\text{Contribution per Unit}}{\text{Selling Price per Unit}}$&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This gives the amount of revenue needed to reach break-even.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;🧮 Example:&lt;span class=&#34;hx-absolute -hx-mt-20&#34; id=&#34;-example&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#-example&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s say:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fixed Costs = ₹50,000/month&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Variable Cost per Unit = ₹10&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Selling Price per Unit = ₹25&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Step 1: Contribution per Unit&lt;span class=&#34;hx-absolute -hx-mt-20&#34; id=&#34;step-1-contribution-per-unit&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#step-1-contribution-per-unit&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;$$
₹25 - ₹10 = ₹15
$$&lt;h3&gt;Step 2: Break-Even Quantity&lt;span class=&#34;hx-absolute -hx-mt-20&#34; id=&#34;step-2-break-even-quantity&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#step-2-break-even-quantity&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;$$
\frac{₹50,000}{₹15} ≈ 3,333 \text{ units}
$$&lt;p&gt;So, the firm must sell &lt;strong&gt;3,333 units&lt;/strong&gt; per month to &lt;strong&gt;break even&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;📊 Graphical Representation (Break-Even Chart)&lt;span class=&#34;hx-absolute -hx-mt-20&#34; id=&#34;-graphical-representation-break-even-chart&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#-graphical-representation-break-even-chart&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can visualize the break-even point on a graph where:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;X-axis = Units Sold&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Y-axis = Amount (Revenue / Cost)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Two lines intersect:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Total Revenue Line&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Total Cost Line&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;point of intersection&lt;/strong&gt; is the &lt;strong&gt;break-even point&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Variable Costs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

      <title>Broker&#39;s responsibility to the principal</title>

      <description>
        
        
        &lt;h2&gt;A broker has a number of responsibilities to their principal, including:&lt;span class=&#34;hx-absolute -hx-mt-20&#34; id=&#34;a-broker-has-a-number-of-responsibilities-to-their-principal-including&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#a-broker-has-a-number-of-responsibilities-to-their-principal-including&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Loyalty:&lt;/strong&gt; The broker must act in the best interests of their principal at all times. This means avoiding any conflicts of interest and not disclosing confidential information to third parties.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Skill and care:&lt;/strong&gt; The broker must exercise a reasonable degree of skill and care in carrying out their duties. This includes keeping up to date with market developments and providing accurate information to their principal.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Transparency:&lt;/strong&gt; The broker must be transparent with their principal about their fees and any other commissions they may be earning. They must also disclose any potential conflicts of interest.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Accountability:&lt;/strong&gt; The broker is accountable to their principal for their actions. If the broker breaches any of their duties, their principal may be able to sue them for damages.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Here are some specific examples of the broker&amp;rsquo;s responsibilities to the principal in the context of ship chartering:&lt;span class=&#34;hx-absolute -hx-mt-20&#34; id=&#34;here-are-some-specific-examples-of-the-brokers-responsibilities-to-the-principal-in-the-context-of-ship-chartering&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;li&gt;The broker must identify and source suitable ships for the charterer that meet their specific requirements.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The broker must negotiate the charter contract on behalf of the charterer, securing the best possible terms and conditions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The broker must keep the charterer informed of market developments and any potential risks to their charter.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The broker must monitor the vessel&amp;rsquo;s performance and ensure that the shipowner is meeting their obligations under the charter contract.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The broker must resolve any disputes that may arise between the charterer and the shipowner.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The broker&amp;rsquo;s responsibilities to the principal are governed by a number of factors, including the terms of the agency agreement between the broker and the principal, the law of the jurisdiction in which the broker is operating, and any relevant industry codes of conduct.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is important for both the broker and the principal to be aware of their respective rights and responsibilities. This will help to ensure that the chartering process is conducted smoothly and efficiently.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;h1&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Calculation of Demurrage&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How are Demurrage Charges calculated?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;hx-absolute -hx-mt-20&#34; id=&#34;how-are-demurrage-charges-calculated&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#how-are-demurrage-charges-calculated&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;strong&gt;calculation of demurrage&lt;/strong&gt; amount payable to shipowner, demurrage rate is multiplied by the &lt;strong&gt;number of days&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;part of day&lt;/strong&gt; in &lt;strong&gt;excess&lt;/strong&gt; of the &lt;strong&gt;agreed laytime&lt;/strong&gt;. For example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Total Laytime Allowed 11 days&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Demurrage Rate $60,000 per day pro rata (PDPR)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ship exceeded laytime allowed for loading and discharging by 4 days 6 hours 30 mins&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Demurrage Payable&lt;/strong&gt; =4d 6h 30m x $60,000 per day =4.27083 days x $60,000 = $256,250&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to arrive at the &lt;strong&gt;number of days on demurrage,&lt;/strong&gt; a calculation of the time in port must be made making reference to the &lt;strong&gt;time allowed (laytime)&lt;/strong&gt; and whether time is counting or whether it is an exception and does not count. Demurrage calculation is similar to using a stopwatch in that the clock will continue to run until there is a qualifying exception and the time will stop. Therefore, in any charter-party it is important to know exactly &lt;strong&gt;when the agreed laytime has expired&lt;/strong&gt; as the ship, from that point, ship will be &lt;strong&gt;on demurrage&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;‘Once on Demurrage, Always on Demurrage’&lt;/strong&gt; phrase is sometimes overused and often misleading. It is crucial to note that the rules for the &lt;strong&gt;stopwatch&lt;/strong&gt; change when a ship is on demurrage and careful attention must be paid to the &lt;strong&gt;detail of the specific charter-party&lt;/strong&gt; when this happens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;General rule is that &lt;strong&gt;express exceptions&lt;/strong&gt; to laytime &lt;strong&gt;do not apply to demurrage&lt;/strong&gt; unless there is &lt;strong&gt;clear wording&lt;/strong&gt; in the charter-party to that effect. Theoretically, the clock &lt;strong&gt;does not&lt;/strong&gt; stop running once the ship has gone on demurrage,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, Asbatankvoy – Clause 7 last sentence reads as follows: Time consumed by the ship in moving from loading or discharge port anchorage to her loading or discharge berth, discharging ballast water or slops, will &lt;strong&gt;not count&lt;/strong&gt; as used lay time. If the ship was moving from the anchorage to the berth and the laytime at that time had &lt;strong&gt;not been used up&lt;/strong&gt; then time will &lt;strong&gt;not run&lt;/strong&gt; during the period of &lt;strong&gt;moving to the berth.&lt;/strong&gt; On the other hand, if &lt;strong&gt;lay time had expired&lt;/strong&gt; and the &lt;strong&gt;ship was on demurrage&lt;/strong&gt; then time would &lt;strong&gt;continue to run&lt;/strong&gt; for such an event and the owner is entitled to demurrage for this time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Great care must be taken over the &lt;strong&gt;wording of the charter-party&lt;/strong&gt; for events which &lt;strong&gt;interrupt laytime&lt;/strong&gt; to apply to demurrage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Demurrage &lt;strong&gt;would not run&lt;/strong&gt; where there is a &lt;strong&gt;fault on the part of the shipowner&lt;/strong&gt;. For example, a &lt;strong&gt;ship breakdown&lt;/strong&gt;, as shipowner &lt;strong&gt;should not be able to profit&lt;/strong&gt; (paid for demurrage) for his own breach of contract. &lt;strong&gt;General exceptions clauses&lt;/strong&gt; will &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; apply to demurrage unless the wording specifically supports this. &lt;strong&gt;Time on demurrage ends&lt;/strong&gt; at the same time as &lt;strong&gt;laytime&lt;/strong&gt; would have done, such as when &lt;strong&gt;completion of cargo operations&lt;/strong&gt; in dry bulk market or when disconnection of cargo hoses in the tanker market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When is Demurrage Payable?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;hx-absolute -hx-mt-20&#34; id=&#34;when-is-demurrage-payable&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#when-is-demurrage-payable&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gencon Charterpary (GENCON 94) Clause 7 states ‘Demurrage shall fall due day by day and shall be payable &lt;strong&gt;upon receipt of the owners’ invoice.’&lt;/strong&gt; In this case an owner is entitled to submit an invoice every day for as long as the vessel is on demurrage. Clearly where there are long delays and large amounts of demurrage incurred the owner may want to do so to ensure that the charterer becomes liable immediately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In practice a claim is submitted at the end of the voyage and, after a period of negotiating the details and amount, agreement is reached and one payment made for the entire claim. Absent the Gencon wording, it is generally accepted that demurrage is payable day by day. However some charterparties will include express terms about the timing of payment which will need to be examined on a case-by-case basis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is Demurrage?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;hx-absolute -hx-mt-20&#34; id=&#34;what-is-demurrage&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#what-is-demurrage&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Demurrage&lt;/strong&gt; refers to the &lt;strong&gt;liquidated damages payable by the charterers to the shipowner&lt;/strong&gt; for failing to complete the loading or discharging of the ship within the &lt;strong&gt;agreed laytime period.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Demurrage is not payable when the charter party expressly provides that certain periods of time lost, such as &lt;strong&gt;breakdown&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;inefficiency&lt;/strong&gt; of the ship, shall &lt;strong&gt;not count&lt;/strong&gt; for demurrage, However, the general rule is &lt;strong&gt;“once on demurrage, always on demurrage”&lt;/strong&gt; i.e., if a ship is on demurrage, no laytime exceptions such as Sundays and holidays can be deducted from the computation of demurrage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;–&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Demurrage Rate&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;hx-absolute -hx-mt-20&#34; id=&#34;demurrage-rate&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#demurrage-rate&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Demurrage is the name given to the damages payable by the Charterer to the Shipowner for the &lt;strong&gt;Charterer’s Breach of Charterparty&lt;/strong&gt; in delaying the ship beyond the agreed laytime. &lt;strong&gt;Demurrage is Liquidated Damages&lt;/strong&gt; that means the rate per day is fixed at the time the charterparty is agreed. Furthermore, Shipowners (Disponent Owners) and Charterters know in advance their respective liabilities/earnings in the event of a delay. This is distinct from Damages at Large which would require a Shipowner to prove his losses. For demurrage, the Shipowner only has to prove that the delay falls within the terms of demurrage for the relevant charterparty. The &lt;strong&gt;Demurrage Rate&lt;/strong&gt; agreed is much like the Freight Rate, &lt;strong&gt;Demurrage Rate&lt;/strong&gt; will be a reflection of the running costs of the ship and the market conditions. Usually, the &lt;strong&gt;Demurrage Rate&lt;/strong&gt; is agreed in the charterparty as a &lt;strong&gt;Daily Rate&lt;/strong&gt;. For part of a day, the rate is pro rated as.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Once on Demurrage, Always on Demurrage&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;hx-absolute -hx-mt-20&#34; id=&#34;once-on-demurrage-always-on-demurrage&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#once-on-demurrage-always-on-demurrage&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If a &lt;strong&gt;charterer detains the vessel beyond the agreed lay days&lt;/strong&gt;, then the charterer is in &lt;strong&gt;breach of contract&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The majority of charter-parties include a clause providing that he may retain the vessel for additional days in order to complete the loading or discharging operation on payment of a &lt;strong&gt;fixed daily amount&lt;/strong&gt;, known as &lt;strong&gt;demurrage&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the late nineteenth century this additional period was judicially referred to as &lt;strong&gt;lay days that have to be paid for&lt;/strong&gt;. This is a misleading description since it conceals the fact that, in reality, the charterer is in breach of contract even though he is entitled, on payment of the agreed rate, ‘to detain the ship for the purpose of enabling him, if possible, to perform his broken contract and so mitigate any further damage’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, it is an anomalous position since, despite the breach, the shipowner is unable to rescind the contract and withdraw his ship during the demurrage period unless the failure of the charterer to load amounts to a repudiation of the contract on his part, or the delay is so substantial as to frustrate the object of the charter-party. This principle applies whether the charter stipulates for a fixed number of days on demurrage or no time limit is expressed as, e.g., ‘eight days for loading, after which demurrage at £2,000 per diem’. At common law a demurrage clause is purely a creation of contract and is in the nature of a provision for agreed damages for detention of the vessel beyond the agreed lay days. The stipulated sum is recoverable by the shipowner irrespective of proof of damage, and represents the maximum amount recoverable for loss resulting from the detention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Demurrage&lt;/strong&gt; will thus cover losses of freight arising under subsequent charter-parties affected by the delay, or from the consequent reduction in the number of voyages possible under a consecutive voyage charter-party. On the other hand, it will not extend to limit claims for losses arising from causes other than detention as, for example, from failure to load a full cargo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As with any other provision for &lt;strong&gt;liquidated damages&lt;/strong&gt;, a &lt;strong&gt;demurrage clause&lt;/strong&gt; may be struck down by the courts as a penalty if the rate is fixed so high as to be &lt;strong&gt;extravagant&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;unconscionable&lt;/strong&gt; in comparison with the greatest possible loss that could flow from the breach. In such circumstances the courts would consider the shipowner adequately compensated by being allowed to recover his actual loss. A similar principle would not appear to be applicable in reverse in cases where the rate is fixed at an &lt;strong&gt;unreasonably low level&lt;/strong&gt;. In such an event the shipowner is unable to recover his actual loss but is limited to the &lt;strong&gt;specified demurrage rate&lt;/strong&gt; even though the delay has been deliberately caused by the charterer for his own benefit. Such a situation may be open to abuse at times when costs and freight rates are rising and the shipowner may be left without an effective remedy should excessive delay result in him losing a subsequent charter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The actual rate of demurrage will be stated in the charter-party and will normally be fixed at a figure in line with current freight rates at the time of the conclusion of the charter. As such fixtures are often made well in advance, the figure may bear little resemblance to prevailing freight rates by the time demurrage becomes payable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Liability for the payment of demurrage accrues immediately on the expiration of the lay days and runs continuously&lt;/strong&gt; through Sundays, holidays and other periods normally excluded from laytime, e.g. bad weather working days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rule is &lt;strong&gt;once on demurrage, always on demurrage&lt;/strong&gt;. For a similar reason, laytime exceptions are held not to be applicable to a demurrage period unless expressly worded to that effect. Thus in a case in which the &lt;strong&gt;House of Lords had refused to allow a charterer&lt;/strong&gt; to invoke a &lt;strong&gt;strike exception after laytime had expired&lt;/strong&gt;, Lord Reid justified the decision on the grounds that ‘the shipowner might well say: true, your breach of contract in detaining my ship after the end of laytime did not cause the strike, but if you had fulfilled your contract the strike would have caused no loss because my ship would have been on the high seas before it began: so it is more reasonable that you should bear the loss than that I should’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, the &lt;strong&gt;once on demurrage rule&lt;/strong&gt; may still apply even though the event covered by the exception occurs before the expiry of laytime. An exception can be &lt;strong&gt;expressly worded&lt;/strong&gt; so as to cover the demurrage period as, for example, where it was provided that demurrage was to be paid ‘at 12s 6d per hour unless detention arises from a lock-out, strikes etc.’ Similarly, demurrage will not accrue during a period where delay was due to the &lt;strong&gt;fault of the shipowner&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;resulted from action taken by&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;the shipowner&lt;/strong&gt; for his own convenience. It will, however, accrue where the delay is &lt;strong&gt;accidental&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;not due to the fault of either shipowner or charterer&lt;/strong&gt;. Even where the delay results from a breach of contract by the shipowner, demurrage may &lt;strong&gt;still be payable&lt;/strong&gt; if the length of such delay is beyond the reasonable contemplation of the parties as a possible consequence of the breach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Demurrage as Liquidated Damages&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;hx-absolute -hx-mt-20&#34; id=&#34;demurrage-as-liquidated-damages&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#demurrage-as-liquidated-damages&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It should be remembered that since demurrage represents the amounts which the Shipowners (Disponent Owners) and Charterers have agreed are &lt;strong&gt;payable by the Charterer&lt;/strong&gt; to the Shipowner to recompense it for any losses which it has suffered as a result of the &lt;strong&gt;detention of the ship beyond laytime&lt;/strong&gt;, it follows that the Shipowner may not be able to recover other losses which it has suffered as a result. These &lt;strong&gt;Liquidated Damages (Demurrage)&lt;/strong&gt; represent all the damages which can be recovered by the Shipowner where the laytime is exceeded. Therefore, the Shipowner (Disponent Owner) may not be able to recover extra bunkers or port costs incurred by it as a result of the delay or even the loss of a valuable next cargo (fixture) which is cancelled as a result of the delay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To recover other losses, the Shipowner must show that the charterer is also in breach of another provision of the charterparty. For example, in a case called Reider v Arcos (1926) Case, the Shipowner proved that, as a result of the charterer’s delay, the ship could not leave port with a full cargo because the depth of water over the bar had dropped. The charterer therefore loaded less cargo than it would have loaded if there had been no delay and the owner recovered deadfreight for the Charterer’s breach on top of demurrage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;**Ship Detention **&lt;span class=&#34;hx-absolute -hx-mt-20&#34; id=&#34;ship-detention&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#ship-detention&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Laytime is at the free disposal of the charterer&lt;/strong&gt; since he is regarded as having paid for it in the freight. He is entitled to use it in the way which suits him best and, provided that the agreed period is not exceeded, the shipowner is not entitled to complain that the cargo could have been loaded in a shorter time. ‘The method of loading  and discharging the ship is entirely a matter for the charterers to decide. Nor is it of any consequence to the owners whether the loading or discharge proceed very slowly on some days and exceptionally fast on others or at an even pace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All that matters to the owners is the actual time occupied by those operations.’ The most striking example of this principle in operation is to be found in the case of Margaronis Navigation Agency v Peabody where a vessel had been chartered  to load a full and complete cargo of maize at an average rate of 1,000 tons per weather working day of 24 hours, Sundays and holidays excepted. The charterers were required by the master to provide a cargo of 12,600 tons and when, by 5 p.m. on Friday, 27 December, all but 11 tons of this amount had been loaded, they instructed the stevedores to stop work as they were anxious for business reasons to obtain January bills of lading. Loading  was resumed at 8 a.m. on Tuesday, 2 January, the next working day in the port, and was completed in 40 minutes, after which the vessel sailed. Although the operation had been completed within the agreed lay-time, the shipowners nevertheless &lt;strong&gt;claimed damages for detention&lt;/strong&gt; on the  ground that &lt;strong&gt;the charterers had wrongfully detained the vessel for their own purposes&lt;/strong&gt; after a full cargo had been loaded. While admitting that the charterer’s obligation ‘was to load a full and complete cargo subject to the de minimis rule’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Court of Appeal nevertheless upheld the decision of the arbitrator that, in  view  of  the accuracy of the loading equipment being used, a shortage of approximately 12 tons (i.e. less than 0.01 per cent) was &lt;strong&gt;not a commercially insignificant amount&lt;/strong&gt; and so the &lt;strong&gt;charterers were entitled to detain the vessel until the balance of the agreed cargo was loaded&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In contrast, once the loading operation has been completed, the &lt;strong&gt;charterer has no right to detain the vessel further&lt;/strong&gt;, even though the &lt;strong&gt;laytime has not expired&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Nolisement (Owners) v Bunge y Born the loading was completed some 19 days before the expiration of the lay days, but the charterers delayed a further three days before presenting bills of lading to the master since they were &lt;strong&gt;unable to decide on the port of discharge&lt;/strong&gt;. They were held &lt;strong&gt;liable for damages for two days’ detention&lt;/strong&gt;. It would seem a little inconsistent for the charterer to be penalized for &lt;strong&gt;detaining the vessel after the completion of loading&lt;/strong&gt; if he could retain complete freedom of action by withholding a minimal amount of cargo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, it must be noted that the loading stage is &lt;strong&gt;not complete&lt;/strong&gt; until the cargo is aboard the vessel and also stowed. Although stowage of the cargo is normally the responsibility of the shipowner and the cost is usually borne by him, it is nevertheless regarded as part of the loading operation and the charterer is under an obligation to bring the cargo alongside the vessel in sufficient time to enable the shipowner to complete the stowage within the lay days. With the completion of the loading operation, the end of the second stage of the voyage charter-party is reached and the risk of subsequent delay due to accidental hindrances and obstructions reverts to the shipowner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consequently, if &lt;strong&gt;after the cargo has been stowed the vessel&lt;/strong&gt; is prevented from embarking on the carrying voyage by reason of &lt;strong&gt;ice or bad weather&lt;/strong&gt;, the cost of the delay must be borne by the &lt;strong&gt;shipowner&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Damages for Ship Detention&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;hx-absolute -hx-mt-20&#34; id=&#34;damages-for-ship-detention&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#damages-for-ship-detention&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When there is &lt;strong&gt;no&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;provision&lt;/strong&gt; in the charterparty for the payment of demurrage, a charterer will be liable for damages for &lt;strong&gt;detention&lt;/strong&gt; for all the time he detains the vessel after the expiration of the lay days. In this situation damages are at large and will be assessed by the &lt;strong&gt;court&lt;/strong&gt; in relation to the actual loss suffered by the shipowner, and in accordance with the normal principles governing remoteness of damage in contract.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Damages for detention is also the appropriate remedy where a charter-party stipulates a fixed number of days for the &lt;strong&gt;payment of demurrage&lt;/strong&gt;, and those days have expired. In the latter case, however, the court will normally assess the damages at a figure corresponding to the &lt;strong&gt;agreed demurrage rate&lt;/strong&gt;, though it is open to either party to prove that such a rate &lt;strong&gt;does not&lt;/strong&gt; represent the actual loss suffered by the shipowner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A shipowner is &lt;strong&gt;not allowed to withdraw&lt;/strong&gt; his vessel during any period for which the payment of demurrage has been agreed, unless the delay is such as to &lt;strong&gt;frustrate the object of the charter-party&lt;/strong&gt;. On the other hand, once the &lt;strong&gt;specified demurrage period has expired&lt;/strong&gt; he is &lt;strong&gt;no longer obliged&lt;/strong&gt; to remain in port to complete the loading operation and to be restricted to a claim for damages for detention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If part of the cargo has been loaded, he may sail and claim compensation in the form of &lt;strong&gt;dead freight,&lt;/strong&gt; or, if the charterer has failed to ship any cargo, he may &lt;strong&gt;rescind the charter&lt;/strong&gt; and sue for &lt;strong&gt;damages&lt;/strong&gt; at large. If, however, the delay occurs at the discharging port, he has little option except to complete the unloading operation and claim damages for &lt;strong&gt;detention&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ship Detention in Dry Bulk Shipping&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;hx-absolute -hx-mt-20&#34; id=&#34;ship-detention-in-dry-bulk-shipping&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#ship-detention-in-dry-bulk-shipping&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Damages for ship detention refer to the financial compensation sought by a ship owner or charterer when a vessel is unduly delayed or detained by a third party, such as a port authority, shipper, or consignee. These damages are meant to cover the losses incurred as a result of the vessel being unavailable for other potential charters, increased operational expenses, or other associated costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the event of ship detention, the following steps can be taken to recover damages:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Identify the cause of detention:&lt;/strong&gt; Determine the reason for the delay or detention, such as port congestion, labor strikes, customs issues, or delays in cargo handling. Establish whether the detention was caused by a breach of contract, negligence, or another actionable reason.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Document the detention:&lt;/strong&gt; Keep a detailed record of the events, including the timeline of events, correspondence with the parties involved, and any other relevant documentation. This information will be crucial in supporting a claim for damages.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Calculate damages:&lt;/strong&gt; Determine the amount of damages incurred as a result of the detention. This may include the loss of income from potential charters, additional operational expenses, crew wages, and other associated costs. The calculation should be based on the daily rate specified in the charter party agreement or, in the absence of such an agreement, a reasonable market rate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Notify the responsible party:&lt;/strong&gt; Once the cause of detention and the damages have been identified, inform the responsible party of the situation and provide them with an opportunity to rectify the issue. Keep a record of this communication for future reference.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pursue legal action&lt;/strong&gt;: If the detention is not resolved and the responsible party is unwilling to compensate for the damages, consider seeking legal advice and pursuing a claim in court or through arbitration. Provide all relevant documentation and evidence to support your claim.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mitigate damages:&lt;/strong&gt; While pursuing damages, take steps to mitigate the impact of the detention. This may involve seeking alternative charters, reducing operational costs, or resolving the issue that caused the detention.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Damages for ship detention are meant to compensate the ship owner or charterer for losses incurred due to delays or detention caused by third parties. To recover these damages, it is essential to identify the cause of detention, document the events, calculate the damages, notify the responsible party, and pursue legal action if necessary. Additionally, taking steps to mitigate damages can help reduce the overall impact of the detention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How is Demurrage Calculated?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;Demurrage is a fee charged to the charterer by the shipowner for not loading or unloading the cargo within the agreed-upon laytime. Laytime is the time allocated for these processes, usually specified in the charter party (contract between the shipowner and charterer). Demurrage calculations can vary depending on the specific terms of the contract, but the general process involves the following steps:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Determine the Laytime:&lt;/strong&gt; Laytime is usually stated in hours or days in the charter party. It is the period during which the ship must be loaded and unloaded without incurring demurrage charges.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Calculate Used Laytime:&lt;/strong&gt; Calculate the actual time taken for loading and/or unloading. This may include weekends, holidays, and other exceptions as specified in the contract.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Identify Any Exceptions:&lt;/strong&gt; Identify any time periods excluded from the laytime calculation as per the contract terms, such as bad weather, customs delays, or equipment breakdowns. Subtract these periods from the used laytime to arrive at the adjusted laytime.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Compare Laytime and Adjusted Laytime:&lt;/strong&gt; If the adjusted laytime is less than or equal to the agreed-upon laytime, there is no demurrage. If the adjusted laytime exceeds the agreed-upon laytime, demurrage is incurred.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Calculate Demurrage:&lt;/strong&gt; To calculate demurrage, first determine the excess time by subtracting the agreed-upon laytime from the adjusted laytime. Then, multiply the excess time by the demurrage rate specified in the charter party. The demurrage rate is usually quoted in USD per day or per hour.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Demurrage Calculation Example 1&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;hx-absolute -hx-mt-20&#34; id=&#34;demurrage-calculation-example-1&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#demurrage-calculation-example-1&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Agreed laytime: 5 days&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Actual laytime used: 7 days&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Weather-related delays: 1 day&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Demurrage rate: $15,000 per day&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adjusted laytime = Actual laytime used – Weather-related delays = 7 days – 1 day = 6 days&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the adjusted laytime (6 days) is greater than the agreed laytime (5 days), demurrage is incurred.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Excess time = Adjusted laytime – Agreed laytime = 6 days – 5 days = 1 day&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Demurrage = Excess time × Demurrage rate = 1 day × $13,000 per day = $13,000&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this example, the charterer would be required to pay $13,000 in demurrage charges to the shipowner.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;a href=&#34;#demurrage-calculation-example-2&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here is another example of Demurrage Calculation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assumptions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Agreed laytime: 10 days&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Actual laytime used: 14 days&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Non-working days (e.g., weekends, holidays): 2 days&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Customs-related delays: 1 day&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Demurrage rate: $15,000 per day&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Step 1: Calculate the adjusted laytime Adjusted laytime = Actual laytime used – Non-working days – Customs-related delays = 14 days – 2 days – 1 day = 11 days&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Step 2: Compare laytime and adjusted laytime In this case, the adjusted laytime (11 days) is greater than the agreed laytime (10 days), which means demurrage is incurred.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Step 3: Calculate demurrage Excess time = Adjusted laytime – Agreed laytime = 11 days – 10 days = 1 day&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Demurrage = Excess time × Demurrage rate = 1 day × $15,000 per day = $15,000&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this example, the charterer would be required to pay $15,000 in demurrage charges to the shipowner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Assumptions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Agreed laytime: 8 days&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Actual laytime used: 12 days&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Non-working days (e.g., weekends, holidays): 3 days&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mechanical breakdown delays: 1 day&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Demurrage rate: $12,000 per day&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Step 1: Calculate the adjusted laytime Adjusted laytime = Actual laytime used – Non-working days – Mechanical breakdown delays = 12 days – 3 days – 1 day = 8 days&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Step 2: Compare laytime and adjusted laytime In this case, the adjusted laytime (8 days) is equal to the agreed laytime (8 days), which means no demurrage is incurred.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Step 3: Calculate demurrage Since the adjusted laytime does not exceed the agreed laytime, there is no excess time, and therefore, no demurrage charges are applied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this example, the charterer would not be required to pay any demurrage charges to the shipowner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Agreed laytime: 6 days&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Actual laytime used: 9 days&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Non-working days (e.g., weekends, holidays): 2 days&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Weather-related delays: 1 day&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Demurrage rate: $8,000 per day&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Step 1: Calculate the adjusted laytime Adjusted laytime = Actual laytime used – Non-working days – Weather-related delays = 9 days – 2 days – 1 day = 6 days&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Step 2: Compare laytime and adjusted laytime In this case, the adjusted laytime (6 days) is equal to the agreed laytime (6 days), which means no demurrage is incurred.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Step 3: Calculate demurrage Since the adjusted laytime does not exceed the agreed laytime, there is no excess time, and therefore, no demurrage charges are applied.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;a href=&#34;#how-to-avoid-demurrage-charges&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;To avoid demurrage charges, shippers and consignees can take several steps to ensure cargo is loaded and unloaded within the allowed laytime. Here are some tips to help avoid these charges:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Plan ahead:&lt;/strong&gt; Proper planning and coordination between all parties involved in the cargo handling process can help avoid delays. Make sure the cargo is ready for loading or unloading before the vessel arrives at the port.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Communicate effectively:&lt;/strong&gt; Regular communication with the port, vessel agents, and stevedores can help identify potential issues early, allowing for faster resolution and minimizing delays.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Choose reliable partners:&lt;/strong&gt; Work with reputable shipping lines, freight forwarders, and transport providers to ensure timely delivery and handling of cargo.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Monitor ship schedules:&lt;/strong&gt; Keep track of vessel schedules and be aware of any changes in arrival or departure times. This can help you adjust your plans and avoid demurrage charges.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Understand port requirements:&lt;/strong&gt; Familiarize yourself with port regulations, customs procedures, and documentation requirements to avoid delays caused by non-compliance or missing documents.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Allocate buffer time:&lt;/strong&gt; Allow some buffer time in your planning to accommodate unforeseen delays, such as weather-related disruptions or mechanical issues.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Opt for faster modes of transportation:&lt;/strong&gt; If your cargo is time-sensitive, consider using faster modes of transportation, such as air freight or express shipping services.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Negotiate longer laytime:&lt;/strong&gt; If you anticipate delays in loading or unloading cargo, negotiate a longer laytime with the carrier to provide some flexibility.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Use technology:&lt;/strong&gt; Utilize software and tools to track and manage your shipments more effectively, enabling better visibility and control over your supply chain.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Train your staff:&lt;/strong&gt; Ensure your team is well-trained in handling cargo and documentation to minimize errors that can cause delays.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By following these tips and maintaining open communication with all parties involved, you can reduce the likelihood of incurring demurrage charges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How much does Demurrage Cost in Dry Bulk Shipping?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;hx-absolute -hx-mt-20&#34; id=&#34;how-much-does-demurrage-cost-in-dry-bulk-shipping&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#how-much-does-demurrage-cost-in-dry-bulk-shipping&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cost of demurrage in dry bulk shipping varies based on several factors, including the type of vessel, the market conditions, the cargo being transported, and the specific terms agreed upon in the charter party contract. Demurrage fees are typically calculated on a per-day basis, referred to as a daily demurrage rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some factors that influence the cost of demurrage in dry bulk shipping include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vessel Size and Type:&lt;/strong&gt; The daily demurrage rate can vary depending on the size and type of the vessel, such as Handysize, Supramax, Panamax, or Capesize. Larger vessels usually have higher daily demurrage rates due to their higher operating costs and earning potential.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dry Bulk Shipping Market conditions:&lt;/strong&gt; The daily demurrage rate can be influenced by the supply and demand dynamics in the dry bulk shipping market. During periods of high demand or limited vessel availability, demurrage rates may be higher to reflect the opportunity cost of keeping the vessel idle.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bulk Cargo Type:&lt;/strong&gt; The type of cargo being transported can also impact the demurrage rate, as some cargo types may require specialized handling equipment or additional precautions that can influence the cost of delays.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Charter Party Agreement:&lt;/strong&gt; The demurrage rate, as well as the allowed laytime and free time, are typically negotiated and specified in the charter party agreement between the ship owner and the charterer. The demurrage rate may be influenced by the bargaining power of the parties involved and the specific terms of the agreement.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Geographic Location and Port Conditions:&lt;/strong&gt; Demurrage rates can also be influenced by the geographic location and port conditions, as certain ports may have higher operating costs or be more prone to congestion and delays.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is difficult to provide a specific cost for demurrage in dry bulk shipping, as it can vary widely depending on the factors mentioned above. However, daily demurrage rates can range from a few thousand dollars to tens of thousands of dollars per day, depending on the vessel size, market conditions, and other factors. It is essential for both ship owners and charterers to carefully review and negotiate the demurrage terms in their charter party agreements to minimize the risk of incurring unexpected demurrage costs.&lt;/p&gt;

The specific terms and conditions regarding demurrage charges are outlined in the charter party agreement, which is a contract between the ship owner and the charterer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is a general overview of demurrage responsibilities in dry bulk shipping:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Charterer’s Responsibility:&lt;/strong&gt; In most cases, the charterer is responsible for paying demurrage charges, as they are typically the party organizing the loading and unloading of the cargo at the port. Delays in cargo handling that exceed the allowed laytime specified in the charter party agreement result in demurrage charges, which are then billed to the charterer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shipper or Consignee’s Responsibility:&lt;/strong&gt; In some cases, the responsibility for demurrage charges may be passed on from the charterer to the shipper or consignee if the delays are caused by their actions or negligence. This transfer of responsibility would be outlined in the contracts between the charterer and the shipper or consignee.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shipowner’s Responsibility:&lt;/strong&gt; If the ship owner or their representatives, such as the vessel’s crew or agent, cause delays that result in demurrage charges, the ship owner may be held responsible for those charges. However, this scenario is relatively rare, as demurrage charges are typically associated with cargo handling delays.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is crucial for all parties involved in dry bulk shipping to carefully review and understand the terms and conditions of their contracts, including the charter party agreement and any contracts between the charterer, shipper, and consignee. Clear communication and understanding of each party’s responsibilities can help minimize disputes and unexpected costs related to demurrage charges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is the Process of Demurrage in Dry Bulk Shipping?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;hx-absolute -hx-mt-20&#34; id=&#34;what-is-the-process-of-demurrage-in-dry-bulk-shipping&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#what-is-the-process-of-demurrage-in-dry-bulk-shipping&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The process of demurrage in dry bulk shipping involves several steps, from negotiating the terms in the charter party agreement to calculating and settling the demurrage charges in case of delays. Here’s an overview of the demurrage process in dry bulk shipping:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Negotiating terms in the charter party agreement&lt;/strong&gt;: The charter party agreement is a contract between the ship owner and the charterer that outlines the terms and conditions for the shipment of cargo. This agreement includes the laytime, which is the allowed time for loading and unloading the cargo, as well as the demurrage rate, which is the daily rate charged if the laytime is exceeded.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Notice of readiness (NOR):&lt;/strong&gt; Upon the vessel’s arrival at the port, the ship owner or their representative (usually the ship’s master or agent) issues a notice of readiness (NOR) to the charterer. This notice indicates that the vessel is ready to load or unload cargo. The charterer is then responsible for providing a berth for the vessel and commencing cargo operations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Commencement of Laytime:&lt;/strong&gt; Laytime begins once the vessel has arrived, the NOR has been issued and accepted, and any agreed-upon preconditions have been met. These preconditions may include customs clearance, safety inspections, or other requirements outlined in the charter party agreement.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Monitoring Laytime:&lt;/strong&gt; Throughout the loading and unloading process, the vessel’s agent, master, or other representatives will monitor the time used for cargo operations, ensuring that it does not exceed the allowed laytime.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Calculating Demurrage:&lt;/strong&gt; If the loading or unloading process takes longer than the allowed laytime, demurrage charges will begin to accrue. These charges are calculated using the demurrage rate specified in the charter party agreement, multiplied by the number of days (or part of a day) that the laytime is exceeded.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Settlement of Demurrage Charges:&lt;/strong&gt; Once the cargo operations are complete, and any demurrage charges have been calculated, an invoice for the charges will be issued by the ship owner to the charterer. The charterer is then responsible for paying the demurrage charges according to the terms of the charter party agreement.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By understanding the demurrage process in dry bulk shipping and following the steps outlined in the charter party agreement, all parties can minimize the risk of disputes and ensure smooth and efficient cargo operations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is a Demurrage Charge in Dry Bulk Shipping?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;hx-absolute -hx-mt-20&#34; id=&#34;what-is-a-demurrage-charge-in-dry-bulk-shipping&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#what-is-a-demurrage-charge-in-dry-bulk-shipping&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A demurrage charge in dry bulk shipping is a fee imposed on the charterer when the process of loading or unloading cargo at a port takes longer than the agreed-upon time, known as laytime. Demurrage charges are meant to compensate the ship owner for the additional time the vessel is kept idle at the port, as delays can lead to increased operational costs and the loss of income from potential charters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Demurrage charges are calculated based on a daily rate, which is specified in the charter party agreement between the ship owner and the charterer. Typically, the demurrage charges start accruing after a “free time” period, also known as laytime, has been exceeded. This laytime is a grace period provided by the carrier for loading or unloading the cargo without incurring additional charges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In dry bulk shipping, demurrage charges are associated with the vessel itself rather than specific cargo or containers, as dry bulk cargo is typically loaded and unloaded directly onto or from the vessel using specialized equipment. By minimizing delays in cargo handling and adhering to the laytime agreed upon in the charter party agreement, the charterer can avoid or reduce demurrage charges in dry bulk shipping.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is Despatch equals to Half Demurrage (HD) in Ship Chartering?  (D=HD)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;hx-absolute -hx-mt-20&#34; id=&#34;what-is-despatch-equals-to-half-demurrage-hd-in-ship-chartering-dhd&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#what-is-despatch-equals-to-half-demurrage-hd-in-ship-chartering-dhd&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despatch equal to Half Demurrage (HD) in ship chartering is a clause that can be included in the charter party agreement between the ship owner and the charterer. It specifies that if the loading or unloading process is completed in less time than the agreed-upon laytime, the ship owner will reward the charterer with a financial incentive called despatch. In this particular clause, the despatch rate is set at half the rate of the demurrage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The purpose of including a “Despatch equals to Half Demurrage” clause in the charter party agreement is to encourage the charterer to expedite cargo handling operations, which in turn benefits the ship owner by allowing the vessel to depart earlier and be available for other potential charters. This helps improve the overall efficiency of the shipping process and can lead to cost savings for both parties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To calculate despatch under the HD clause, the following steps are taken:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Determine the actual time used for loading or unloading, and compare it to the allowed laytime in the charter party agreement.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Calculate the time saved by subtracting the actual time used from the allowed laytime.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Apply the “Half Demurrage” rate to the time saved by multiplying the saved time by half the demurrage rate specified in the agreement.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The resulting amount is the despatch payable by the ship owner to the charterer as a reward for completing the cargo handling process faster than the agreed-upon laytime.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By including a “Despatch equals to Half Demurrage” clause in the charter party agreement, both the ship owner and the charterer can benefit from increased efficiency in the loading and unloading process.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;h3&gt;Capital Budgeting: Deciding Whether to Invest&lt;span class=&#34;hx-absolute -hx-mt-20&#34; id=&#34;capital-budgeting-deciding-whether-to-invest&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#capital-budgeting-deciding-whether-to-invest&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Capital budgeting is the process companies use for decision-making on capital projects – those projects with a life of a year or more. It helps determine whether a project is worth pursuing based on its potential profitability and risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Criteria&lt;span class=&#34;hx-absolute -hx-mt-20&#34; id=&#34;discounted-cash-flow-dcf-criteria&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#discounted-cash-flow-dcf-criteria&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;DCF techniques consider the &lt;strong&gt;time value of money&lt;/strong&gt;, meaning that a rupee received today is worth more than a rupee received in the future due to its potential earning capacity. These methods discount future cash flows back to their present value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are the primary DCF criteria used to decide on project investments:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;1. Net Present Value (NPV)&lt;span class=&#34;hx-absolute -hx-mt-20&#34; id=&#34;1-net-present-value-npv&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#1-net-present-value-npv&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;NPV calculates the present value of all expected future cash inflows minus the present value of all expected future cash outflows of a project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Formula:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$\qquad NPV = \sum_{t=0}^{n} \frac{CF_t}{(1 + r)^t}$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$NPV$ = Net Present Value&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$CF_t$ = Cash flow at time $t$ (CF₀ is usually the initial investment and is negative)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$r$ = Discount rate (cost of capital)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$n$ = Number of periods&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Decision Rule:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If $NPV &amp;gt; 0$: &lt;strong&gt;Accept&lt;/strong&gt; the project. It is expected to add value to the firm.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If $NPV &amp;lt; 0$: &lt;strong&gt;Reject&lt;/strong&gt; the project. It is expected to decrease the firm&amp;rsquo;s value.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If $NPV = 0$: The project is neither adding nor destroying value. Acceptance might depend on other factors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;2. Internal Rate of Return (IRR)&lt;span class=&#34;hx-absolute -hx-mt-20&#34; id=&#34;2-internal-rate-of-return-irr&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#2-internal-rate-of-return-irr&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;IRR is the discount rate at which the NPV of a project equals zero. It represents the effective rate of return a project is expected to yield.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Formula:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The IRR is the value of $r$ that satisfies the following equation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$\qquad 0 = \sum_{t=0}^{n} \frac{CF_t}{(1 + IRR)^t}$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This formula is typically solved using financial calculators or spreadsheet software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Decision Rule:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If $IRR &amp;gt; \text{Cost of Capital (r)}$: &lt;strong&gt;Accept&lt;/strong&gt; the project. The project&amp;rsquo;s return exceeds the required rate of return.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If $IRR &amp;lt; \text{Cost of Capital (r)}$: &lt;strong&gt;Reject&lt;/strong&gt; the project. The project&amp;rsquo;s return is less than the required rate of return.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If $IRR = \text{Cost of Capital (r)}$: Acceptance is marginal and might depend on other factors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;3. Profitability Index (PI)&lt;span class=&#34;hx-absolute -hx-mt-20&#34; id=&#34;3-profitability-index-pi&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#3-profitability-index-pi&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Profitability Index (also known as the Benefit-Cost Ratio) measures the present value of the future cash flows relative to the initial investment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Formula:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$\qquad PI = \frac{\sum_{t=1}^{n} \frac{CF_t}{(1 + r)^t}}{|CF_0|}$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$PI$ = Profitability Index&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$\sum_{t=1}^{n} \frac{CF_t}{(1 + r)^t}$ = Present value of future cash inflows&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$|CF_0|$ = Absolute value of the initial investment (cash outflow at time 0)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Decision Rule:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If $PI &amp;gt; 1$: &lt;strong&gt;Accept&lt;/strong&gt; the project. The present value of benefits is greater than the cost.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If $PI &amp;lt; 1$: &lt;strong&gt;Reject&lt;/strong&gt; the project. The present value of benefits is less than the cost.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If $PI = 1$: The present value of benefits equals the cost. Acceptance might depend on other factors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Non-Discounted Cash Flow Criteria&lt;span class=&#34;hx-absolute -hx-mt-20&#34; id=&#34;non-discounted-cash-flow-criteria&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#non-discounted-cash-flow-criteria&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Non-discounted cash flow techniques &lt;strong&gt;do not consider the time value of money&lt;/strong&gt;. They are simpler to calculate but may not provide as accurate a picture of a project&amp;rsquo;s profitability, especially for long-term projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are the primary non-discounted cash flow criteria:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;1. Payback Period (PB)&lt;span class=&#34;hx-absolute -hx-mt-20&#34; id=&#34;1-payback-period-pb&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#1-payback-period-pb&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The payback period is the number of years it takes for a project to recover its initial investment from the cumulative cash inflows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Calculation:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For projects with equal annual cash flows:&lt;/strong&gt;
$\qquad \text{Payback Period} = \frac{\text{Initial Investment}}{\text{Annual Cash Inflow}}$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For projects with unequal annual cash flows:&lt;/strong&gt; The payback period is determined by adding up the cash inflows year by year until the initial investment is recovered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Decision Rule:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If the payback period is &lt;strong&gt;less than&lt;/strong&gt; a predetermined target period: &lt;strong&gt;Accept&lt;/strong&gt; the project.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If the payback period is &lt;strong&gt;greater than&lt;/strong&gt; a predetermined target period: &lt;strong&gt;Reject&lt;/strong&gt; the project.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Limitations:&lt;/strong&gt; This method ignores the time value of money and cash flows occurring after the payback period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;2. Accounting Rate of Return (ARR)&lt;span class=&#34;hx-absolute -hx-mt-20&#34; id=&#34;2-accounting-rate-of-return-arr&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#2-accounting-rate-of-return-arr&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Accounting Rate of Return (also known as the Average Rate of Return) is the average annual profit after tax divided by the average investment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Formula:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$\qquad ARR = \frac{\text{Average Annual Profit After Tax}}{\text{Average Investment}}$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Average Investment is often calculated as (Initial Investment + Salvage Value) / 2.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Decision Rule:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If $ARR$ is &lt;strong&gt;greater than&lt;/strong&gt; a predetermined target rate of return: &lt;strong&gt;Accept&lt;/strong&gt; the project.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If $ARR$ is &lt;strong&gt;less than&lt;/strong&gt; a predetermined target rate of return: &lt;strong&gt;Reject&lt;/strong&gt; the project.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Limitations:&lt;/strong&gt; This method is based on accounting profits rather than cash flows and ignores the time value of money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Which Criteria to Use?&lt;span class=&#34;hx-absolute -hx-mt-20&#34; id=&#34;which-criteria-to-use&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#which-criteria-to-use&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;While non-discounted methods are simpler, &lt;strong&gt;Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) methods are generally preferred&lt;/strong&gt; for capital budgeting decisions because they account for the time value of money and provide a more accurate assessment of a project&amp;rsquo;s economic viability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NPV&lt;/strong&gt; is often considered the most reliable method as it directly measures the value a project adds to the firm.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;IRR&lt;/strong&gt; is also popular but can have issues with mutually exclusive projects or projects with non-conventional cash flows (multiple sign changes).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PI&lt;/strong&gt; is useful for ranking projects, especially when there are capital constraints.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Non-discounted methods like &lt;strong&gt;Payback Period&lt;/strong&gt; can provide a quick measure of liquidity and risk but should not be the sole basis for long-term investment decisions. &lt;strong&gt;ARR&lt;/strong&gt; is also limited due to its reliance on accounting profits and neglect of the time value of money.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In practice, companies often use a combination of these methods to get a comprehensive view of a project&amp;rsquo;s potential before making an investment decision.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;h2&gt;What are Cargo Circulars?&lt;span class=&#34;hx-absolute -hx-mt-20&#34; id=&#34;what-are-cargo-circulars&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#what-are-cargo-circulars&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Commercial shipping cargo circulars are documents issued by shipping companies, freight forwarders, and other maritime industry stakeholders to provide information and guidance on a variety of topics related to cargo shipping. These circulars can cover a wide range of topics, such as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New or updated shipping regulations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Changes to freight rates or shipping services&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Port congestion or disruptions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dangerous goods shipping requirements&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cargo insurance and claims procedures&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New technologies and trends in cargo shipping&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;The cargo claims procedure is the process of filing a claim with a carrier or insurer for loss or damage to cargo. The specific steps involved in the process may vary depending on the carrier, the type of cargo, and the nature of the loss or damage. However, the general process is as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Notice of damage or loss:&lt;/strong&gt; The first step is to notify the carrier in writing of the damage or loss as soon as possible. This should be done within the time limits specified in the carrier&amp;rsquo;s bill of lading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Documentation:&lt;/strong&gt; The claimant must gather all relevant documentation, including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A copy of the bill of lading&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A copy of the commercial invoice&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A copy of the packing list&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Photographs of the damaged cargo&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A report from a surveyor or inspector&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Any other documents that support the claim&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Submit the claim:&lt;/strong&gt; The claim should be submitted to the carrier or insurer in writing. The claim form should include a detailed description of the damage or loss, the value of the cargo, and copies of the supporting documentation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Investigation:&lt;/strong&gt; The carrier or insurer will investigate the claim to determine if it is valid. This may involve interviewing witnesses, examining the damaged cargo, and reviewing the supporting documentation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Settlement:&lt;/strong&gt; If the claim is valid, the carrier or insurer will settle the claim by paying the claimant the value of the damaged or lost cargo. The amount of the settlement may be based on the actual value of the cargo, the cost of repairs, or the value of the cargo at the destination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Here are some additional tips for filing a cargo claim:&lt;span class=&#34;hx-absolute -hx-mt-20&#34; id=&#34;here-are-some-additional-tips-for-filing-a-cargo-claim&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#here-are-some-additional-tips-for-filing-a-cargo-claim&#34; class=&#34;subheading-anchor&#34; aria-label=&#34;Permalink for this section&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;File the claim as soon as possible:&lt;/strong&gt; The sooner you file the claim, the more likely it is that you will be able to recover your losses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gather all relevant documentation:&lt;/strong&gt; The more documentation you can provide, the stronger your claim will be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Be prepared to cooperate with the carrier&amp;rsquo;s investigation:&lt;/strong&gt; The carrier will need to interview you and inspect the damaged cargo in order to determine if your claim is valid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Consider hiring a cargo claims attorney:&lt;/strong&gt; If your claim is large or complex, you may want to consider hiring a cargo claims attorney to help you file and process your claim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cargo claims can be complex and time-consuming to process. However, by following the steps outlined above and providing the carrier or insurer with all of the necessary documentation, you can increase your chances of recovering your losses.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Cargo insurance rating</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/docs/partc/em303/cargoinsurance/insurancerating/</link>

      <description>
        
        
        &lt;p&gt;Cargo insurance basis of rating refers to the factors that insurance companies consider when calculating the premium for a cargo insurance policy. These factors can be broadly divided into two categories:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cargo-related factors:&lt;/strong&gt; These factors include the type of cargo being insured, its value, its packaging, and the route it will be taking.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Transit-related factors:&lt;/strong&gt; These factors include the mode of transportation, the duration of the journey, and the political and economic stability of the countries involved.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to these general factors, insurance companies may also consider other specific factors, such as the shipper&amp;rsquo;s claims history and the underwriter&amp;rsquo;s own experience with similar risks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most common basis of rating for cargo insurance is the &lt;strong&gt;CIF + 10%&lt;/strong&gt; basis. This means that the premium is calculated based on the cost, insurance, and freight (CIF) value of the cargo, plus an additional 10%. The CIF value is the total cost of the cargo, plus the cost of insurance and freight to the port of destination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other common bases of rating include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Agreed value:&lt;/strong&gt; Under this basis of rating, the insured and the insurer agree on a value for the cargo before the policy is issued. This value is used to calculate the premium and to settle any claims that may arise.
2 &lt;strong&gt;Invoice value:&lt;/strong&gt; Under this basis of rating, the premium is calculated based on the invoice value of the cargo. This is the value of the cargo as stated on the invoice from the seller to the buyer.
3 &lt;strong&gt;Market value:&lt;/strong&gt; Under this basis of rating, the premium is calculated based on the market value of the cargo at the time of the loss. This is the value that the cargo could be sold for on the open market at that time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The basis of rating that is used will vary depending on the specific cargo and the insurance company&amp;rsquo;s underwriting guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Example:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A company is shipping a container of smartphones from China to the United States. The CIF value of the shipment is $1 million. The insurance company agrees to insure the shipment on an agreed value basis. The premium rate is 0.5%. The premium for the policy would be calculated as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Premium = Agreed value x Premium rate&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Premium = $1,000,000 x 0.5%&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Premium = $5,000&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company would pay a premium of $5,000 to insure the shipment for its agreed value of $1 million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is important to note that cargo insurance premiums can vary widely depending on the factors mentioned above. It is therefore important to compare quotes from multiple insurance companies before purchasing a policy.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Cargo insurance underwriting factors</title>

        &lt;p&gt;Cargo insurance underwriting factors are the factors that insurance companies consider when deciding whether or not to insure a cargo shipment and, if so, at what premium. These factors can be broadly divided into two categories:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cargo-related factors:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Type of cargo&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Value of cargo&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Packaging of cargo&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Route of shipment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Perishability of cargo&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Susceptibility of cargo to theft or damage&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Transit-related factors:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mode of transportation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Duration of transit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Political and economic stability of countries involved&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Weather conditions along the route&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Security of ports and warehouses&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to these general factors, insurance companies may also consider other specific factors, such as the shipper&amp;rsquo;s claims history and the underwriter&amp;rsquo;s own experience with similar risks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Here are some specific examples of how cargo insurance underwriting factors can affect the cost of a premium:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Type of cargo:&lt;/strong&gt; High-value or hazardous cargo, such as electronics, jewelry, and chemicals, will typically have higher premiums than lower-value or less hazardous cargo, such as clothing and food.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Route of shipment:&lt;/strong&gt; Shipments traveling through politically unstable or high-crime areas will typically have higher premiums than shipments traveling through more stable areas.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mode of transportation:&lt;/strong&gt; Shipments transported by air or sea are typically more expensive to insure than shipments transported by land.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Duration of transit:&lt;/strong&gt; Shipments that are in transit for a longer period of time are typically more expensive to insure than shipments that are in transit for a shorter period of time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shipper&amp;rsquo;s claims history:&lt;/strong&gt; Shippers with a history of frequent claims will typically have higher premiums than shippers with a good claims history.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When underwriting a cargo insurance policy, insurance companies will weigh all of the relevant factors to determine the risk of the shipment and the appropriate premium.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>cargo risk factors</title>

        &lt;p&gt;A particular cargo policy covers one single shipment of goods and must be consulted and issued before each separate shipment is made. Cargo insurance policies cover the assured against many risks. Older policies might have had a clause that would read, for example, as follows: &amp;ldquo;This insurance is against the perils of the seas, fire, assailing thieves, jettisons, barratry of the Master and mariners and all other like perils, losses or misfortunes that have or shall come to the hurt, detriment or damage of the property insured hereunder or any part thereof except as otherwise provided for herein&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of the perils insured against by far, the most important is &amp;ldquo;the perils of the seas,&amp;rdquo; which refer to fortuitous losses arising through the extraordinary action of the elements at sea. It is often referred to as &amp;ldquo;heavy weather&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;stress of weather.&amp;rdquo; Perils of the seas also include accidents in the navigation or marine causalities, such as sinking, stranding, collision, striking of rocks and icebergs. Most cargo insurance policies, however, are underwritten on an &amp;ldquo;all-risk.&amp;rdquo; basis. This means that the insured is covered for all risk of loss or damage except for those risks that are specifically excluded in the policy such as loss or damage due to willful destruction by the insured, or the inherent vice of the goods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marine cargo insurance is a vital part of international trade. The transportation of goods by sea is inherently risky, and marine insurance is a vital tool to manage that risk. A cargo insurance underwriter will determine whether an applicant for cargo insurance (typically an exporter or an importer) should be approved for cargo insurance under what terms of average (loss). Underwriters evaluate insurance applications and determine coverage amounts and premiums.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an underwriter, one needs to understand and evaluate many factors to appraise each risk. Some of these factors are:
The desired average (loss) clauses: The assured may choose average clauses ranging from the most limited to the most comprehensive coverage. The choice of average clauses has a substantial effect on premium rates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The destination or origin:&lt;/strong&gt; The geographical, physical, or political conditions at the port of origin and destination create differences in the risks involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The ocean carrier:&lt;/strong&gt; You will need to evaluate the integrity of the vessel(s) to be used, looking to the vessel&amp;rsquo;s age, classification society, among other factors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3.**The shipping routes: No two shipping routes present identical risks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The time for shipping: Greater damage may be sustained by goods shipped across the North Atlantic in winter than in summer, and rainwater damage is more prevalent in the monsoon season than in the dry season.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The packing used: Packing, whether by container, pallet or otherwise, can vary considerably, with resulting variance in premium rates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shipping practices: Newcomers to foreign trade may not have experienced traffic personnel. Even experienced shippers vary greatly in their shipping practices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The assured: The underwriter&amp;rsquo;s experience with the assured is a valuable guide to determining whether to accept the risk and under what terms. For example, an adverse loss ratio requires careful consideration by the underwriter as to whether the risk should be accepted.&lt;/p&gt;
