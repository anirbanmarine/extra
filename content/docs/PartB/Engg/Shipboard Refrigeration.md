A shipboard refrigeration system consists of the following main components:

## Primary Components:

1. Compressor: Compresses refrigerant, raising its temperature and pressure.
2. Condenser: Cools the hot refrigerant gas, converting it into a liquid.
3. Evaporator (or Coil): Absorbs heat from the cargo or space, causing refrigerant to evaporate.
4. Expansion Valve (or Orifice): Reduces refrigerant pressure, allowing expansion.

### Auxiliary Components:

1. Refrigerant: Transfers heat from evaporator to condenser (e.g., R-404A, R-134a).
2. Controls and Sensors:
    - Thermostats
    - Pressure switches
    - Temperature sensors
    - Flow meters
3. Pumps and Motors:
    - Compressor motor
    - Condenser water pump
    - Evaporator fan motor
4. Valves:
    - Suction valve
    - Discharge valve
    - Defrost valve
    - Drain valve
5. Pipework and Fittings: Connects components, ensuring refrigerant flow.

### Additional Components (dependent on system type):

1. Accumulator (for flooded systems)
2. Receiver (for direct expansion systems)
3. Defrost System (electric or hot gas)
4. Air-cooled or Water-cooled Heat Exchangers
5. Oil Separator (for compressors)

### Refrigeration System Types:

1. Vapor Compression Cycle (VCC)
2. Absorption Cycle
3. Evaporative Cooling
4. Direct Expansion (DX) System
5. Flooded System

#### Shipboard Refrigeration Applications:

1. Cargo Refrigeration (e.g., containers, bulk cargo)
2. Provision Cooling (e.g., food storage)
3. Air Conditioning (e.g., passenger areas)
4. Freeze Protection (e.g., piping, machinery)
