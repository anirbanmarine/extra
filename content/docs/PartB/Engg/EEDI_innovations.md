Ship designers have implemented a variety of innovative measures to reduce the EEDI figure for new vessels and retrofits to existing vessels. These measures focus on improving energy efficiency, reducing fuel consumption, and minimizing greenhouse gas emissions. Here are some examples:

### New Vessel Design

* **Hull Optimization:**
    * **Bulbous bows:** These reduce wave resistance and improve fuel efficiency.
    * **Hull lines:** Streamlined hull shapes minimize drag.
    * **Propeller design:** Optimized propellers improve thrust and reduce cavitation.
* **Energy-Efficient Propulsion Systems:**
    * **Dual-fuel engines:** These can run on a combination of conventional fuels and cleaner alternatives like liquefied natural gas (LNG).
    * **Hybrid propulsion:** Combining diesel-electric and battery power can reduce fuel consumption and emissions.
    * **Shaft generators:** Capturing waste energy from the propeller shaft to generate electricity.
* **Weight Reduction:**
    * **Lightweight materials:** Using materials like aluminum or composites can reduce vessel weight and fuel consumption.
    * **Optimized cargo hold design:** Efficient use of space reduces deadweight.
* **Energy-Efficient Equipment:**
    * **LED lighting:** Energy-efficient lighting systems reduce electrical power consumption.
    * **Variable speed drives:** Controlling the speed of equipment like pumps and fans can save energy.
    * **Heat recovery systems:** Reusing waste heat for heating or other purposes.

### Retrofits to Existing Vessels

* **Hull modifications:** Adding a bulbous bow or optimizing hull lines can improve hydrodynamic efficiency.
* **Engine upgrades:** Replacing old engines with more efficient models can reduce fuel consumption.
* **Propeller optimization:** Upgrading propellers or installing propeller ducts can improve efficiency.
* **Energy-saving systems:** Installing energy-efficient equipment like LED lighting, variable speed drives, and heat recovery systems.
* **Waste heat recovery:** Capturing and utilizing waste heat from the engine or exhaust can reduce energy consumption.

By implementing these innovative measures, ship designers are making significant strides in reducing the EEDI figure for new vessels and improving the energy efficiency of existing fleets. These advancements contribute to a more sustainable and environmentally friendly maritime industry.
