title: MARPOL Annex VI â€“ Resolution MEPC.203(62)
type: docs
toc: true
---


This resolution, adopted in July 2011, was a significant step in addressing air pollution from ships. It introduced regulations aimed at improving the energy efficiency of ships, specifically through:

1. **Energy Efficiency Existing Ship Index (EEXI):** This index measures a ship's energy efficiency relative to a baseline. Existing ships must comply with certain EEXI requirements by specific deadlines.
2. **Ship Energy Efficiency Management Plan (SEEMP):** All ships must have a SEEMP in place, outlining measures to improve their energy efficiency and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

**Key Points:**

- **Applies to:** All ships of 400 gross tonnage and above.
- **EEDI (Energy Efficiency Design Index):** New ships built after July 2013 must meet specific EEDI requirements to limit their carbon footprint.
- **SEEMP:** This plan details how a ship will achieve and maintain energy efficiency, including measures like hull design optimization, engine efficiency improvements, and operational practices.
- **DCS (Data Collection System):** Ships must collect and report data on fuel oil consumption and other relevant parameters to monitor and verify compliance.

**Goal:**

The overarching goal of these regulations is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from international shipping, contributing to efforts to mitigate climate change.

**Impact:**

MEPC.203(62) has been a driving force in the shipping industry's transition towards more energy-efficient practices. It has led to the development of new technologies and operational strategies that reduce fuel consumption and emissions.

**Additional Developments:**

Since the adoption of MEPC.203(62), the IMO has continued to strengthen its regulations on air pollution from ships. This includes further amendments to Annex VI, such as the introduction of a Carbon Intensity Indicator (CII) for existing ships and the development of a strategy to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from international shipping.
