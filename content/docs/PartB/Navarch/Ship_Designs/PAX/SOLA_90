## SOLAS 90 Requirements for Passenger Ferries

**SOLAS 90** refers to the amendments to the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS) adopted in 1988 and entering into force in 1990. These amendments introduced significant changes, particularly in the area of damage stability for passenger ferries.

### Key SOLAS 90 Requirements for Passenger Ferries

* **Damage Stability:**
  * Introduced stricter damage stability standards to ensure that ferries can survive damage and remain afloat in severe sea conditions.
  * Required ships to meet specific criteria based on the size and passenger capacity of the vessel.
  * This involved calculations and assessments to determine the ship's ability to withstand flooding and maintain stability.

* **Watertight Doors:**
  * Mandated power-operated sliding watertight doors, except in specific cases.
  * Required these doors to be capable of being closed from a central control station within 60 seconds.
  * Emphasized the importance of keeping watertight doors closed to prevent flooding.

* **Ro-Ro Passenger Ships:**
  * Introduced specific requirements for ro-ro passenger ferries carrying 400 or more passengers.
  * Focused on safety measures to address the unique challenges of these types of vessels.

### Additional Considerations

* **Stockholm Agreement:** While not part of SOLAS 90, the Stockholm Agreement further enhanced safety standards for ro-ro passenger ferries operating in specific sea areas.
* **Ongoing Amendments:** SOLAS is a living document, and subsequent amendments have built upon the foundation laid by SOLAS 90.
* **Flag State Regulations:** Individual flag states may have additional or stricter requirements beyond SOLAS.

### Importance of Compliance

Adherence to SOLAS 90 and subsequent amendments is crucial for ensuring the safety of passengers and crew on passenger ferries. Non-compliance can lead to severe consequences, including loss of life and property.
