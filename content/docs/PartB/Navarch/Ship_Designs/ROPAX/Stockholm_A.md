## The Stockholm Agreement: Enhanced Stability for Ro-Ro Passenger Ships

The Stockholm Agreement is a regional agreement that introduced stricter damage stability standards for ro-ro passenger ships operating in specific sea areas. It was developed in response to the tragic sinking of the MS Estonia ferry in 1994.

### Key Features of the Stockholm Agreement:

* **Complement to SOLAS 90:** The agreement builds upon the existing SOLAS 90 regulations, providing additional safety measures.
* **Focus on Severe Sea Conditions:** The Stockholm Agreement addresses the specific challenges faced by ro-ro passenger ships in sea states between 1.5 meters and 4 meters significant wave height.
* **Water Accumulation on Ro-Ro Decks:** Unlike SOLAS 90, the agreement considers the potential accumulation of water on the ro-ro decks in case of damage.
* **Sea Area-Based Requirements:** The specific stability requirements vary depending on the sea area where the ship operates. This is determined by the significant wave height in the region.
* **Calculation Methodology:** A specific method is outlined in the agreement to calculate the height of water on the ro-ro deck following damage based on the ship's residual freeboard and the significant wave height.

### Impact of the Stockholm Agreement:

The Stockholm Agreement has significantly improved the safety of ro-ro passenger ships operating in its coverage area. By requiring higher stability standards, it reduces the risk of capsizing in severe sea conditions.

**It's important to note that while the Stockholm Agreement has been influential, the maritime industry continues to evolve, and newer regulations, such as SOLAS 2020, have introduced further enhancements to passenger ship safety.**
