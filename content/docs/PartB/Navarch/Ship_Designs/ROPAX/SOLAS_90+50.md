title: A Shift Towards Probabilistic Safety Assessment SOLAS 90 plus 50
type: docs
---
**SOLAS 90+50** is a term often used to collectively refer to the **SOLAS 90** damage stability standards and the **Stockholm Agreement**, as well as the subsequent **SOLAS 2009** regulations, which introduced a probabilistic approach to ship safety.

### Key Points:

* **SOLAS 90:** Established deterministic damage stability requirements for ships, particularly focusing on passenger ferries.
* **Stockholm Agreement:** Introduced additional, stricter stability standards for ro-ro passenger ships operating in specific sea areas, particularly in response to the MS Estonia tragedy.
* **SOLAS 2009:** Marked a significant shift from deterministic to probabilistic methods for assessing ship safety. This involved using statistical models to evaluate the likelihood of various damage scenarios and their consequences.

### Why the Shift to Probabilistic Approach?

The probabilistic approach offers several advantages:

* **More Realistic Assessment:** It considers a wider range of potential damage scenarios, providing a more accurate picture of ship safety.
* **Improved Risk Management:** By quantifying risks, it allows for better decision-making in ship design and operation.
* **Enhanced Safety:** Ultimately, it aims to improve the overall safety of ships and passengers.

### Challenges and Considerations:

* **Complexity:** Probabilistic methods require sophisticated calculations and modeling, which can be complex and resource-intensive.
* **Data Availability:** Accurate data on damage scenarios and their consequences is essential for reliable probabilistic assessments.
* **Industry Adoption:** The transition from deterministic to probabilistic methods requires a significant learning curve for the maritime industry.

Despite these challenges, the move towards probabilistic safety assessment is a crucial step in enhancing maritime safety.
