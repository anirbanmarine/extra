### **Maritime Cybersecurity & Safety Management: Identification of Data Theft and Compromise**

The integration of IT (Information Technology) and OT (Operational Technology) systems on vessels has created new efficiencies but also significant vulnerabilities. The IMO Resolution MSC.428(98) requires cyber risks to be appropriately addressed in Safety Management Systems (SMS) no later than the first annual verification of the company’s Document of Compliance after 1 January 2021.

Identifying the theft of classified data is a cornerstone of this requirement. It's not just about preventing financial loss; it's about preventing safety incidents that could result from compromised operational data.

#### **Step 1: Define "Classified Data" in a Maritime Context**

Before you can identify theft, you must know what you are protecting. "Classified" or "sensitive" data on a vessel or within a shipping company can be categorized as:

*   **Operational Data (Safety-Critical):**
    *   **Voyage Plan:** ECDIS route plans, waypoints, and schedules. (Compromise could lead to route manipulation, piracy, or collision).
    *   **GPS/GNSS Data:** Real-time and logged vessel positioning.
    *   **Propulsion & Machinery Control Data:** Engine parameters, steering commands, power management settings.
    *   **Ballast Water Management System (BWMS) Logs:** Data on treatment and discharge.
    *   **Cargo Control Data:** For tankers, data on valve positions, pump speeds, and tank levels.

*   **Commercial & Security Data (Business-Critical):**
    *   **Cargo Manifest:** Details of the goods being transported, their value, and consignee. (Highly valuable for pirates, thieves, and competitors).
    *   **Port of Call Information & Security Plans:** Details on port security measures, schedules, and personnel.
    *   **Corporate Financials:** Invoicing, charter party agreements, and payment information.
    *   **Vessel and Fleet Management Data:** Performance data, maintenance schedules, and operational costs.

*   **Personnel Data (Privacy-Critical):**
    *   **Crew & Passenger Lists:** Names, passport numbers, and other Personally Identifiable Information (PII).
    *   **Crew Payroll and Banking Information.**
    *   **Login Credentials:** Usernames and passwords for onboard and shore-based systems.

#### **Step 2: Understand the Threat Vectors (How Data is Stolen)**

1.  **Cyber Attacks (External):**
    *   **Phishing/Spear-Phishing:** Emails disguised as legitimate notices from port authorities, agents, or manning agencies, tricking crew into revealing credentials or downloading malware.
    *   **Malware/Ransomware:** Malicious software introduced via infected USB drives, compromised software updates, or downloads, which can lock or exfiltrate data.
    *   **Exploitation of Vulnerabilities:** Targeting unpatched systems, such as the vessel’s business network, VSAT communications unit, or even the ECDIS operating system.

2.  **Insider Threats (Internal):**
    *   **Malicious Insider:** A disgruntled or bribed crew member or employee intentionally stealing data using their authorized access.
    *   **Unintentional Insider:** A crew member accidentally exposing data through poor security hygiene (e.g., losing an unencrypted USB drive, using a weak password, connecting a personal infected device to the ship's network).

3.  **Physical Access:**
    *   Unauthorized personnel (e.g., contractors, visitors) gaining physical access to servers, workstations, or network ports on the vessel.
    *   Theft of hardware like laptops, hard drives, or servers.

### **Step 3: Identification of Theft and Compromise**

Identification is a multi-layered process involving technical monitoring, procedural checks, and human awareness. These indicators are often subtle and must be correlated.

#### **A. Technical Indicators (System-Level Detection)**

These are typically identified by IT/OT personnel or through automated security systems.

1.  **Anomalous Network Traffic:**
    *   **Indicator:** Unusual outbound data flows, especially at odd hours or to unrecognized IP addresses/countries. A large data packet leaving the ship’s network for a destination in a country with no business connection is a major red flag.
    *   **Tool:** Network Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS), firewalls with egress filtering logs, Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) systems.

2.  **Unauthorized Access Alerts:**
    *   **Indicator:** Multiple failed login attempts on a critical system (e.g., cargo control console, ECDIS), followed by a successful login from an unusual location or time.
    *   **Tool:** Centralized authentication logs (e.g., Active Directory), application-specific security logs. User and Entity Behavior Analytics (UEBA) can flag deviations from normal user behavior.

3.  **Presence of Malware or Unauthorized Tools:**
    *   **Indicator:** Antivirus/antimalware software alerts. Discovery of data exfiltration tools (e.g., FTP clients, data packet sniffers) or hacking software on systems where they shouldn't be.
    *   **Tool:** Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR), antivirus scans, regular system integrity checks.

4.  **System Performance Degradation:**
    *   **Indicator:** Critical systems like the ECDIS, loading computer, or communication systems suddenly become slow or unresponsive. This can be a sign of malware consuming resources while it encrypts or exfiltrates data in the background.
    *   **Tool:** Performance monitoring tools, crew reports.

5.  **Data Manipulation or Unavailability:**
    *   **Indicator:** A ransom note appearing on a screen is the most obvious sign. More subtly, files may be missing, file names or extensions changed (e.g., `.docx` becomes `.locked`), or the data within a file (like a route plan) is altered.
    *   **Tool:** File Integrity Monitoring (FIM) systems, which alert when critical files are changed.

6.  **Data Loss Prevention (DLP) Alerts:**
    *   **Indicator:** A specific alert from a DLP solution that a user is attempting to copy, print, or transfer a file marked as "classified" (e.g., the cargo manifest) to an unauthorized location, like a personal USB drive or a webmail service.
    *   **Tool:** A dedicated Data Loss Prevention (DLP) solution.

#### **B. Procedural and Human Indicators (Operational-Level Detection)**

These are often noticed by the crew and officers as part of their daily duties and are a critical part of the "human firewall."

1.  **Unusual Inquiries for Sensitive Data:**
    *   **Indicator:** A crew member or a shore-based employee asking for data they do not need for their job role. A shore-based "accountant" asking for the detailed voyage plan is suspicious.
    *   **Indicator:** An external email requesting the crew list or cargo manifest, citing a vague or unusual reason.

2.  **Discovery of Unauthorized Devices:**
    *   **Indicator:** Finding a personal, non-approved USB drive, laptop, or mobile device connected to a critical network (e.g., the OT network controlling machinery). Physical security rounds should include checks for this.

3.  **Social Engineering Clues:**
    *   **Indicator:** A crew member reports receiving a suspicious email or phone call. Promoting a "no-blame" culture for reporting such incidents is vital.

4.  **Physical Security Breaches:**
    *   **Indicator:** Evidence of tampering with server room doors, unlocked computer terminals, or missing hardware (laptops, hard drives).

5.  **External Notification:**
    *   **Indicator:** The most unfortunate way to find out. A law enforcement agency, a port authority, or a business partner informs you that your sensitive data (e.g., a cargo manifest) has been found on the dark web or was used in a crime.

### **Integrating Identification into the Safety Management System (SMS)**

The identification process cannot be ad-hoc. It must be formalized within the SMS.

*   **Risk Assessment:** Identify critical data and systems. Assess the risks of theft and the potential safety/commercial consequences.
*   **Procedures & Policies:**
    *   Develop clear procedures for **reporting** suspicious technical and human indicators.
    *   Establish a formal **Incident Response Plan** that outlines immediate actions upon identifying a potential breach (e.g., who to call, which systems to isolate).
    *   Implement strict **Access Control** policies (least privilege principle).
    *   Create policies for the use of **Removable Media** (e.g., company-issued, encrypted USBs only).
*   **Training & Awareness:**
    *   Train all crew and shore staff on identifying both technical and human indicators of a breach.
    *   Conduct regular phishing simulation exercises to test and reinforce this training.
*   **Auditing & Review:**
    *   Regularly audit logs (firewall, access, system logs).
    *   Review the effectiveness of identification measures after any incident or drill.

### **Conclusion**

Identifying the theft and compromise of classified data in the maritime sector is a dynamic challenge that requires a holistic approach. It blends advanced **technical monitoring** with robust **procedural controls** and, most importantly, a **well-trained, vigilant crew**. By defining what is sensitive, understanding the threats, and implementing a multi-layered identification strategy within the existing Safety Management System, a shipping company can move from a reactive to a proactive cyber-safety posture, protecting its assets, its people, and its operations.
