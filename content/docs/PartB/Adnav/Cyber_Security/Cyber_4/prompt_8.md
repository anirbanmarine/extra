Of course. Managing the provision of information to third parties is one of the most critical and complex aspects of cybersecurity for a maritime port. A port is a dynamic ecosystem of interconnected entities, and a failure in one can cascade through the entire supply chain.

Here is a comprehensive framework for managing information provision to third parties at a maritime port, broken down into strategy, process, and technical controls.

### **The Challenge: The Port as a Digital Hub**

A modern port is not just a physical location; it's a dense digital hub. Information is constantly exchanged with a wide array of third parties:

*   **Shipping Lines:** Vessel schedules (ETA/ETD), cargo manifests, stowage plans, booking data.
*   **Haulage & Rail Companies:** Container release codes, pickup/drop-off schedules, gate access information.
*   **Customs & Border Agencies:** Manifest data, crew lists, security declarations, cargo inspection status.
*   **Terminal Operators:** Inter-terminal transfer data, operational plans, equipment status.
*   **Vessel Agents & Pilots:** Berthing information, port services requests, navigation data.
*   **IT & OT Service Providers:** System access, maintenance logs, network diagrams.
*   **Suppliers:** Invoices, purchase orders, maintenance schedules for equipment like cranes and sensors.

Each connection is a potential attack vector. A compromised haulage company could lead to cargo theft. A breached shipping line could provide false data, causing port congestion or even physical accidents.

### **Core Principle: A Zero Trust, Data-Centric Approach**

The foundational strategy should be **Zero Trust**. This means you **"never trust, always verify."** No user or system, whether inside or outside the port's network, should be trusted by default. This is coupled with a **data-centric** approach, where security controls are applied to the data itself, not just the network perimeter.

### **A 6-Step Framework for Third-Party Information Management**

#### **Step 1: Identification and Classification**

You cannot protect what you don't know.

1.  **Identify All Third Parties:** Maintain a comprehensive inventory of every external entity that receives information from the port.
2.  **Map Data Flows:** For each third party, document:
    *   **What** information do they need? (e.g., Container ID, vessel ETA, invoice number).
    *   **Why** do they need it? (Justify the business requirement).
    *   **How** do they receive it? (API, Port Community System, email, SFTP).
    *   **How often** do they need it? (Real-time, daily, weekly).
3.  **Classify the Data:** Classify the data being shared based on its sensitivity. This will determine the level of security required.
    *   **Public:** General port information, vessel schedules.
    *   **Internal/Sensitive:** Operational plans, staff rosters.
    *   **Confidential:** Cargo manifests, commercial invoices, personal data (crew/driver info).
    *   **Restricted/Critical:** System credentials, OT data that could impact physical safety (e.g., crane control commands), security access codes.

#### **Step 2: Risk Assessment and Due Diligence**

Before providing any access, vet the third party's security posture.

1.  **Tiered Risk Profiling:** Not all partners are equal. A global shipping line with a mature security program is different from a small local trucking company. Create risk tiers (e.g., High, Medium, Low).
2.  **Security Questionnaires:** For medium- and high-risk partners, require the completion of a standardized security questionnaire based on frameworks like NIST CSF or ISO 27001. Key questions include:
    *   Do you have a formal information security policy?
    *   How do you manage user access and passwords?
    *   Do you conduct regular vulnerability scanning and penetration testing?
    *   Do you have a documented Incident Response Plan?
    *   Are your employees trained on cybersecurity awareness?
3.  **Review and Validate:** Don't just accept the answers. For high-risk partners, ask for evidence (e.g., a redacted copy of a recent pen-test report, security certifications).

#### **Step 3: Contractual and Legal Agreements**

Formalize security expectations in legally binding contracts.

1.  **Data Protection Addendum (DPA):** This should be a standard part of any contract.
2.  **Key Clauses to Include:**
    *   **Confidentiality:** Clear definition of what constitutes confidential information.
    *   **Purpose Limitation:** The third party can only use the data for the specified, agreed-upon purpose.
    *   **Security Requirements:** Mandate specific security controls (e.g., encryption, access control, MFA).
    *   **Incident Notification:** A strict requirement to notify the port of a suspected or confirmed breach within a defined timeframe (e.g., 24-48 hours).
    *   **Right to Audit:** The port's right to audit the third party's security controls, or require them to provide a third-party audit report (e.g., SOC 2 Type II).
    *   **Secure Off-boarding:** A requirement for the secure deletion or return of all port data upon contract termination.
    *   **Liability:** Clear language on liability in the event of a breach caused by the third party's negligence.

#### **Step 4: Secure Technical Controls for Information Exchange**

This is how you enforce the policies defined in the previous steps.

1.  **Principle of Least Privilege:** Grant the absolute minimum level of access and information required for the third party to perform its function.
2.  **Use Modern, Secure Methods:**
    *   **APIs (Application Programming Interfaces):** This is the preferred method. It allows for granular, controlled, and auditable access to data without giving direct system access. Secure APIs with authentication tokens (OAuth 2.0), rate limiting, and robust logging.
    *   **Port Community System (PCS):** A PCS acts as a single, neutral, and secure digital platform. By centralizing data exchange through the PCS, you can enforce uniform security standards for all participants.
    *   **Secure File Transfer Protocol (SFTP):** If file transfers are necessary, use SFTP, not legacy FTP. Ensure servers are hardened and user access is tightly restricted to specific directories.
    *   **Avoid Email:** Do not use email for sharing sensitive or operational data. It is insecure, hard to audit, and prone to phishing attacks.
3.  **Enforce Strong Access Controls:**
    *   **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Define roles (e.g., "Haulage Dispatcher," "Customs Agent") with specific permissions. Assign users to roles rather than granting individual permissions.
    *   **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** Mandate MFA for any third-party access to port systems, especially the PCS or partner portals.
4.  **Encrypt Everything:**
    *   **Data in Transit:** Use TLS 1.2 or higher for all connections (APIs, SFTP, web portals).
    *   **Data at Rest:** Encrypt sensitive data stored in databases or file systems.

#### **Step 5: Ongoing Monitoring and Auditing**

Trust is not a one-time event; it must be continuously verified.

1.  **Log and Monitor All Access:** Log every API call, file download, and login from third parties. Use a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system to analyze these logs for anomalous behavior (e.g., access from an unusual country, unusually large data downloads).
2.  **Periodic Reviews:** Don't let access become stale.
    *   Conduct annual reviews of each third party's access rights.
    *   Re-issue security questionnaires periodically (e.g., annually for high-risk, every 2-3 years for low-risk).
3.  **Automated Scanning:** Continuously scan your external-facing systems (APIs, portals) for vulnerabilities.

#### **Step 6: Incident Response and Off-boarding**

Plan for the worst and ensure a clean exit.

1.  **Joint Incident Response Plan:** For critical partners, establish a joint plan. Who contacts whom in a crisis? What are the immediate steps to isolate a breach? Conduct tabletop exercises to test the plan.
2.  **Off-boarding Process:** Have a formal, documented process for terminating a third-party relationship. This is a critical security step.
    *   Immediately revoke all digital access (API keys, user accounts, VPN access).
    *   Formally request and receive confirmation of data destruction as stipulated in the contract.
    *   Update the third-party inventory.

### **Scenario in Practice: Onboarding a New Haulage Company**

*   **Request:** "ABC Trucking" needs to know when containers are cleared by customs and available for pickup.
*   **Action Plan:**
    1.  **Identify & Classify:** Partner is "ABC Trucking." Data is "Container ID" and "Customs Status." This data is **Confidential**.
    2.  **Risk Assess:** They are a small, local company. Classify as **Medium Risk**. Send them the standard security questionnaire. Review their answers.
    3.  **Contract:** Sign a service agreement that includes the port's standard Data Protection Addendum.
    4.  **Technical Controls:**
        *   **Do not** give them a login to the Terminal Operating System (TOS).
        *   **Instead,** provide them with a unique, read-only API key that can only query the status of specific container numbers they are contracted to carry.
        *   The API should not return any other information (e.g., cargo contents, shipper).
    5.  **Monitor:** Log all API calls from ABC Trucking's key. Alert the security team if they make an excessive number of queries or query containers not on their list.
    6.  **Off-boarding:** If the contract ends, the API key is immediately revoked in the API gateway. The process is logged.

By following this structured framework, a maritime port can enable the necessary flow of information to keep the supply chain moving while systematically managing risk and protecting its critical digital and physical infrastructure.
