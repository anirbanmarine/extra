Of course. Establishing a **Port Cyber-Security Committee (PCSC)** is a foundational step in creating a robust and resilient cyber security posture for any maritime port. It moves cyber security from a siloed IT issue to a strategic, port-wide governance priority.

Here is a comprehensive breakdown of the purpose, structure, responsibilities, and operational framework of a Port Cyber-Security Committee.

---

### **1. The Mandate and Purpose of the Port Cyber-Security Committee (PCSC)**

The PCSC is the central governance body responsible for the strategic direction, oversight, and coordination of all cyber security initiatives across the entire port ecosystem.

**Its primary purpose is to:**

*   **Establish a Unified Strategy:** Ensure a cohesive approach to cyber security that aligns with the port's business objectives, operational realities, and regulatory requirements.
*   **Manage Port-Wide Cyber Risk:** Identify, assess, and mitigate cyber risks to both Information Technology (IT) and, critically, Operational Technology (OT).
*   **Foster Collaboration:** Bridge the gap between the port authority, terminal operators, tenants, shipping lines, and government agencies.
*   **Ensure Resilience:** Develop and maintain the port's ability to withstand, respond to, and recover from a cyber incident with minimal disruption to operations.
*   **Drive a Culture of Security:** Champion cyber security awareness and best practices at all levels, from the boardroom to the dockside.

### **2. Why the Committee is Essential in a Maritime Port**

Ports are unique and highly vulnerable environments due to:

*   **IT/OT Convergence:** The blending of corporate networks (IT) with industrial control systems (OT) that manage physical operations like cranes, gates, and vessel traffic services (VTS). An attack on OT can cause physical chaos.
*   **Interconnected Ecosystem:** A port is not a single entity. It's a complex network of independent companies (terminal operators, logistics providers, customs) that must share data. A vulnerability in one can compromise the entire port.
*   **Critical National Infrastructure:** Ports are economic gateways. Disruption can have significant national and international economic and supply chain consequences.
*   **Regulatory Pressure:** Growing regulations from bodies like the International Maritime Organization (IMO), the US Coast Guard (USCG), and the EU (NIS2 Directive) mandate formal risk management processes.

### **3. Committee Composition: Who Should Be at the Table?**

The committee's strength lies in its cross-functional representation. It must include leaders who can make decisions and allocate resources.

#### **Core Members (from the Port Authority)**

*   **Chairperson:** A senior executive, such as the Chief Operating Officer (COO) or a dedicated Chief Information Security Officer (CISO). This person must have authority and influence.
*   **Chief Information Officer (CIO) / Head of IT:** Represents the IT infrastructure, corporate systems, and data management.
*   **Head of Operations / Harbour Master:** The voice of the physical port. Represents vessel movements, cargo handling, and the realities of the OT environment.
*   **Head of Engineering / OT Lead:** Provides deep technical expertise on Industrial Control Systems (ICS), SCADA systems, and equipment like cranes and sensors.
*   **Chief Financial Officer (CFO) / Finance Rep:** Crucial for budget allocation, cyber insurance, and understanding the financial impact of risks and incidents.
*   **Head of Legal & Compliance:** Advises on regulatory requirements, liability, data privacy laws, and incident reporting obligations.
*   **Head of Physical Security:** To integrate cyber and physical security plans (e.g., access control, CCTV monitoring).
*   **Head of Human Resources:** Responsible for personnel security policies, background checks, and security awareness training programs.

#### **Expanded Members / Regular Invitees (Representing the Port Community)**

*   **Representatives from Terminal Operators:** As key tenants, their systems are deeply integrated with the port's. Their participation is non-negotiable.
*   **Representatives from Major Shipping Lines/Agents:** To align on vessel-to-shore interface security and data exchange protocols.
*   **Local Customs and Border Protection Agency:** Critical partner for securing the flow of cargo information (e.g., customs declarations).
*   **Vessel Traffic Services (VTS) Manager:** VTS is a critical safety and operational system highly vulnerable to cyber-attack.
*   **Local Law Enforcement / Coast Guard Liaison:** For incident response coordination and intelligence sharing.

### **4. Key Responsibilities and Activities**

The PCSC is an active, working body. Its responsibilities can be categorized as follows:

#### **A. Governance and Strategy**
*   **Develop and Approve the Port Cyber Security Charter:** The founding document outlining the committee's mission, scope, and authority.
*   **Define the Port's Risk Appetite:** Determine the level of cyber risk the port is willing to accept.
*   **Develop and Maintain the Port-Wide Cyber Security Strategy & Roadmap:** Set priorities, goals, and timelines.
*   **Budgetary Oversight:** Review and recommend cyber security budgets for necessary technology, personnel, and training.

#### **B. Risk Management**
*   **Oversee Port-Wide Risk Assessments:** Commission and review regular assessments of both IT and OT environments.
*   **Maintain a Port-Wide Risk Register:** Track identified vulnerabilities and the status of mitigation efforts.
*   **Review Threat Intelligence:** Discuss the latest cyber threats targeting the maritime and logistics sectors.

#### **C. Policy and Resilience**
*   **Approve Key Cyber Security Policies:** Such as access control, data classification, third-party risk management, and acceptable use.
*   **Oversee the Development of the Cyber Incident Response Plan (CIRP):** Ensure the plan is comprehensive, tested, and understood by all stakeholders.
*   **Commission Regular Drills and Exercises:** Mandate and review tabletop exercises and full-scale simulations that test the portâ€™s response and recovery capabilities.

#### **D. Communication and Reporting**
*   **Report to the Board of Directors/Port Commissioners:** Provide regular updates on the port's cyber security posture, key risks, and strategic initiatives.
*   **Facilitate Information Sharing:** Create a trusted forum for port community members to share threat information and best practices.
*   **Manage Crisis Communications:** Oversee the communication strategy during and after a major cyber incident.

### **5. Operational Framework: Making the Committee Effective**

*   **Formal Charter:** The committee must have a board-approved charter that defines its:
    *   Mission and Scope
    *   Membership and Roles
    *   Decision-Making Authority
    *   Meeting Cadence
    *   Reporting Structure
*   **Meeting Cadence:**
    *   **Quarterly:** For regular strategic reviews, risk updates, and progress monitoring.
    *   **Ad-hoc/Emergency:** A clear protocol for convening the committee immediately in response to a credible threat or active incident.
*   **Sub-Committees/Working Groups:** For complex topics, create smaller, dedicated groups.
    *   **OT Security Working Group:** A technical group with engineers and OT specialists.
    *   **Incident Response Planning Group:** To draft and test the CIRP.
    *   **Supply Chain Security Working Group:** To focus on risks from third-party vendors and partners.
*   **Action Tracking:** All meetings should have clear minutes, with assigned action items, owners, and deadlines to ensure accountability.

### **Conclusion**

A Port Cyber-Security Committee is not just another meeting. It is the central nervous system for a port's cyber defense. By bringing together leaders from operations, technology, finance, and the wider port community, the PCSC transforms cyber security from a technical problem into a core component of operational resilience, strategic planning, and business continuity for the entire maritime hub.
