### **Maritime Cyber Security: A Deep Dive into Third-Party Risk Assessments**

The maritime industry is a highly interconnected ecosystem. A single vessel's operation relies on a complex web of onshore and offshore partners, from satellite communication providers and engine manufacturers to port authorities and software vendors. This interconnectedness is a major source of cyber risk.

A third-party risk assessment is the process of identifying, analyzing, and mitigating the cybersecurity risks introduced to your organization (e.g., a shipping company, a vessel) by its external partners, suppliers, and vendors.

#### **Why is Third-Party Risk So Critical in the Maritime Sector?**

1.  **Interconnected OT and IT Systems:** Third parties often have direct or indirect access to a vessel's most critical systems.
    *   **Operational Technology (OT):** Engine monitoring systems, navigation (ECDIS, GPS), ballast water systems, and cargo management systems are often maintained, updated, or monitored remotely by the manufacturer or a service provider.
    *   **Information Technology (IT):** Crew welfare networks, vessel management software, and communication systems (VSAT) are managed by external entities.

2.  **The "Weakest Link" Principle:** An attacker can bypass a vessel's or company's strong defenses by targeting a more vulnerable third party. A breach at a vendor's office can become a direct threat to a fleet of ships.

3.  **Regulatory and Compliance Mandates:**
    *   **IMO Resolution MSC.428(98):** Requires ship owners and managers to address cyber risks in their Safety Management Systems (SMS) as of January 1, 2021. This implicitly includes risks originating from third parties.
    *   **Classification Societies (e.g., IACS UR E26 & E27):** These new unified requirements mandate robust cybersecurity for a ship's critical systems, and the responsibility for the security of supplied equipment and software lies with the system integrators and vendors.

4.  **Complex and Global Supply Chains:** The maritime supply chain involves countless entities (ports, terminals, customs, logistics providers). A compromise at any point can have cascading effects, leading to delays, data breaches, or physical disruption.

### **Who Are the "Third Parties" in the Maritime Context?**

Identifying your third parties is the first step. They can be categorized as follows:

| Category | Examples | Potential Risks |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Technology & Service Providers** | - VSAT/Satellite communication providers<br>- ECDIS and navigation software vendors<br>- Vessel performance monitoring services<br>- Cloud hosting providers (e.g., for fleet data) | Remote access backdoors, malware in software updates, data breaches of fleet information, communication interception. |
| **Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) & Maintenance** | - Engine manufacturers (e.g., Wärtsilä, MAN)<br>- Propulsion and automation system makers<br>- Onboard technicians and service engineers | Compromised diagnostic laptops, insecure remote access for maintenance, malware introduced via USB drives. |
| **Port & Terminal Operators** | - Port authorities<br>- Terminal operators<br>- Pilotage services | Manipulation of berth allocation systems, false information on vessel arrival/departure, disruption of cargo loading/unloading. |
| **Supply Chain & Logistics Partners** | - Charterers<br>- Manning agents<br>- Customs brokers<br>- Bunker (fuel) suppliers | Phishing attacks using legitimate business context, data breaches of sensitive cargo manifests, invoice fraud. |
| **Regulatory & Classification Bodies** | - Flag States<br>- Classification Societies (e.g., DNV, Lloyd's Register)<br>- Port State Control inspectors | While often trusted, their systems could be compromised, leading to fraudulent certificates or data leaks. |

### **The Third-Party Risk Assessment Process: A Step-by-Step Guide**

A robust third-party risk management program is a continuous cycle, not a one-time check.

#### **Step 1: Identify and Categorize Your Third Parties**
*   **Inventory:** Create a comprehensive inventory of all third parties.
*   **Tiering:** Not all vendors pose the same level of risk. Categorize them based on the criticality of the data or systems they can access.
    *   **Tier 1 (High Risk):** Direct access to critical OT/IT systems (e.g., engine OEM, VSAT provider).
    *   **Tier 2 (Medium Risk):** Access to sensitive but non-critical systems (e.g., crew management software provider).
    *   **Tier 3 (Low Risk):** No access to systems or sensitive data (e.g., office stationery supplier).

#### **Step 2: Define Assessment Criteria**
Establish a clear security baseline that you expect your vendors to meet. This should be based on industry standards and regulations:
*   NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)
*   ISO 27001/27002
*   BIMCO Cyber Security Clause 2019
*   Guidelines from Oil Companies International Marine Forum (OCIMF)

#### **Step 3: Conduct the Assessment (Due Diligence)**
The depth of the assessment should correspond to the vendor's risk tier.

*   **Questionnaires:** Use standardized security questionnaires (e.g., Consensus Assessments Initiative Questionnaire - CAIQ) to gauge a vendor's security posture. Ask specific maritime questions:
    *   *“Do your technicians use dedicated, hardened laptops for onboard service?”*
    *   *“How do you secure your remote access connections to our vessel's systems?”*
    *   *“Describe your process for ensuring software updates are free of malware.”*

*   **Documentation Review:** Request and review security documentation, such as:
    *   SOC 2 Type II reports
    *   ISO 27001 certification
    *   Penetration test results
    *   Incident response plans

*   **Technical Assessments:** For high-risk vendors, you may need to conduct more technical validation, such as reviewing the security architecture of their connection to your vessel.

#### **Step 4: Analyze Findings and Remediate Risks**
*   **Identify Gaps:** Compare the assessment results against your defined criteria.
*   **Risk Register:** Log all identified risks, their potential impact, and likelihood.
*   **Remediation Plan:** Work with the third party to create a time-bound plan to address critical and high-risk findings. If they are unwilling or unable to fix a major vulnerability, you must decide whether to accept the risk or terminate the relationship.

#### **Step 5: Contractual Agreements**
Your legal contracts must include specific cybersecurity clauses.
*   **Right to Audit:** The right for you to assess their security controls.
*   **Security Standards:** The requirement for them to maintain a specific security baseline.
*   **Incident Notification:** A clear requirement to notify you within a specific timeframe (e.g., 24-48 hours) of a security breach that could affect you.
*   **Liability:** Clauses defining liability in the event of a breach caused by the vendor.
*   **The BIMCO Cyber Security Clause** is an excellent industry-standard starting point.

#### **Step 6: Continuous Monitoring and Offboarding**
*   **Periodic Reviews:** Re-assess high-risk vendors annually or after any significant change.
*   **Threat Intelligence:** Monitor for public reports of breaches involving your vendors.
*   **Offboarding:** When a contract ends, have a formal process to revoke all physical and logical access to your systems and data.

### **Challenges and Best Practices**

*   **Challenge:** Limited visibility into the "black box" systems provided by OEMs.
    *   **Best Practice:** Push for greater transparency during procurement. Make security a key purchasing criterion.

*   **Challenge:** Small shipping companies may lack the resources for extensive assessments.
    *   **Best Practice:** Focus on the highest-risk vendors first (the Tier 1 group). Use industry-standard questionnaires to be efficient.

*   **Challenge:** Technicians using personal or infected USBs/laptops onboard.
    *   **Best Practice:** Enforce a strict onboard policy for third-party equipment. Provide a company-sanctioned, clean laptop for their use if necessary.

### **Conclusion**

In modern maritime operations, cybersecurity is synonymous with safety and operational resilience. Because vessels and shipping companies do not operate in a vacuum, managing third-party risk is not optional—it is a fundamental component of any effective maritime cyber risk management program. By implementing a structured, risk-based assessment process, you can gain visibility into your extended cyber-attack surface and take proactive steps to protect your fleet, crew, cargo, and company.
