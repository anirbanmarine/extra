Of course. Here is a comprehensive overview of Maritime Cyber Security Incident Management, broken down into key components, best practices, and a step-by-step lifecycle.

### **Maritime Cyber Security: Incident Management**

Incident Management in the maritime sector is the process of preparing for, detecting, analyzing, containing, eradicating, and recovering from a cyber security incident. Due to the unique environment of a vessel—a complex, isolated, and highly integrated system of Information Technology (IT) and Operational Technology (OT)—a robust incident management plan is not just best practice; it is a regulatory requirement and essential for the safety of the crew, vessel, cargo, and the environment.

The International Maritime Organization (IMO) Resolution MSC.428(98) requires cyber risks to be addressed under the International Safety Management (ISM) Code, making effective incident management a mandatory part of a vessel's Safety Management System (SMS).

### **The Unique Maritime Context: Why It's Different**

Standard IT incident response plans are insufficient for the maritime environment. Key differences include:

*   **IT/OT Convergence:** A cyber-attack can move from the crew's Wi-Fi (IT) to the ship's navigation or engine control systems (OT). The consequences of an OT failure are immediate and physical.
*   **Remote & Isolated Operations:** Vessels are often at sea for weeks with limited, high-latency, and expensive satellite connectivity. You cannot simply send a tech team to fix a problem.
*   **Limited Onboard Expertise:** The crew are maritime professionals, not necessarily cyber security experts. The plan must be executable by non-specialists.
*   **Safety-Critical Systems:** Systems like ECDIS (Electronic Chart Display), GPS, AIS (Automatic Identification System), and engine controls are directly tied to the vessel's safety. Disconnecting a compromised system might not be an option if it's essential for navigation or propulsion.
*   **Complex Supply Chain:** The risk doesn't just come from the internet. It can be introduced by third-party technicians, infected USB drives, or compromised updates from equipment manufacturers.

### **The Cyber Incident Management Lifecycle (The IMO/NIST Framework Adapted for Maritime)

This lifecycle is typically broken down into four key phases.

#### **Phase 1: Preparation (The Most Critical Phase)**

"Before an incident happens" - This is where the foundation for resilience is built.

*   **Develop an Incident Response Plan (IRP):**
    *   This plan must be part of the ship's official SMS.
    *   It should define what constitutes a cyber incident (e.g., ransomware on a cargo manifest PC vs. GPS spoofing).
    *   It must establish clear roles and responsibilities. Who is in charge on the vessel (Master)? Who is the shoreside contact (Company Security Officer/DPA)?
*   **Identify and Map Assets:** Create an inventory of all critical IT and OT systems (e.g., ECDIS, radar, VDR, engine automation, cargo control, satcom). Understand how they connect.
*   **Establish a Response Team:**
    *   **Onboard Team:** Master, Chief Engineer, Officers.
    *   **Shoreside Team:** Company Security Officer (CSO), Designated Person Ashore (DPA), IT/OT department.
    *   **External Support:** Pre-vetted third-party incident response firms, equipment manufacturers, insurers, and legal counsel. Contact details must be readily available onboard and ashore.
*   **Conduct Training and Drills:**
    *   **Tabletop Exercises:** Simulate scenarios like "Our ECDIS is showing us 20 miles off course. What do we do?" or "We've received a ransomware email. What's the protocol?"
    *   **Practical Drills:** Practice isolating a system or switching to manual/analog backups (e.g., using paper charts).
*   **Implement Technical Controls:**
    *   **Backups:** Maintain regular, isolated backups of critical data and system configurations. Test them.
    *   **Network Segmentation:** Separate crew networks from critical operational networks.
    *   **Access Control:** Enforce strong passwords and limit user privileges.

#### **Phase 2: Detection & Analysis**

"When an incident is suspected or discovered"

*   **Detection:** How do you know something is wrong?
    *   **System Alerts:** Antivirus warnings, unusual system alarms, high network traffic.
    *   **Physical Indicators:** A system becomes unresponsive (e.g., a frozen ballast control screen).
    *   **Anomalous Behavior:** The ship's position on the ECDIS differs from GPS or visual cues (GPS spoofing), unexpected engine RPM changes, strange emails.
    *   **Crew Reports:** A crew member reports clicking on a suspicious link.
*   **Initial Analysis & Triage:**
    1.  **Report Immediately:** The crew must immediately report the suspected incident to the Master.
    2.  **Assess the Impact:** The Master, in consultation with the shoreside team, must quickly determine which systems are affected and the potential impact on safety, operations, and the environment.
    3.  **Preserve Evidence:** Do not turn off the machine immediately unless it poses an imminent safety threat. Isolate it from the network and note down everything: what was seen, when, and by whom. Take photos/screenshots if possible.

#### **Phase 3: Containment, Eradication & Recovery**

"Taking action to control and resolve the incident"

*   **Containment:**
    *   **Goal:** Stop the incident from spreading.
    *   **Actions:**
        *   **Isolate:** Disconnect the affected system(s) from the ship's network. This is a critical decision. If the ECDIS is compromised, can you navigate safely without it? The Master's overriding authority is key here.
        *   **Segment:** If possible, change firewall rules or network configurations to block the malicious activity from reaching other parts of the network.
*   **Eradication:**
    *   **Goal:** Remove the threat from the environment.
    *   **Actions:** This may involve removing malware, disabling breached user accounts, or identifying and fixing the vulnerability. This step often requires expert guidance from the shoreside team or a third-party responder.
*   **Recovery:**
    *   **Goal:** Restore systems to normal operation.
    *   **Actions:**
        *   Restore from a known-good backup.
        *   Rebuild systems from scratch if necessary.
        *   Validate that the systems are clean and fully functional before reconnecting them to the network.
        *   Monitor closely for any signs of reinfection.
    *   **Crucial Maritime Step:** Be prepared to operate in a degraded state. This means relying on **manual overrides, analog backups (paper charts), and traditional seamanship skills** until systems are fully restored.

#### **Phase 4: Post-Incident Activity (Lessons Learned)**

"After the incident is resolved"

*   **Incident Report:** Create a detailed report covering the timeline, impact, actions taken, and effectiveness of the response.
*   **Lessons Learned Meeting:** Involve all stakeholders (vessel and shore) to discuss what went well, what didn't, and why.
*   **Update the Plan:** Use the findings to improve the Incident Response Plan, technical controls, and crew training.
*   **External Reporting:** Report the incident as required to:
    *   **Flag State**
    *   **Port State Authorities**
    *   **Insurers**
    *   **Law Enforcement** (if necessary)
    *   **Charterers / Cargo Owners**
