### **Introduction: The Unique Maritime Cyber Threat**

The maritime industry's increasing reliance on digitalization and automation has created significant efficiencies but has also exposed it to a new class of cyber threats. Unlike typical IT environments, maritime cyber security must address the convergence of **Information Technology (IT)** and **Operational Technology (OT)**. A successful attack can lead to catastrophic consequences, including:

*   **Safety Risks:** Loss of navigation, vessel control, or safety systems, endangering the crew, vessel, and cargo.
*   **Environmental Disasters:** Manipulation of ballast water or fuel systems, leading to spills.
*   **Economic Disruption:** Cargo theft, vessel downtime, port closures, and supply chain paralysis.
*   **Reputational Damage:** Loss of trust from customers and partners.

Protection and detection measures must be holistic, covering the vessel, the shore-side operations, and the communication links between them.

## 1. Protection Measures (Proactive Defense)

These are measures put in place to prevent a cyber incident from occurring.

### A. Technical Protection Measures

These involve the use of hardware and software to build a resilient and secure technological infrastructure.

| Measure | Description | Key Systems Affected |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. Network Segmentation** | Isolate critical OT networks from non-essential IT networks. Use firewalls and VLANs to create "watertight compartments." For example, the **Navigation System (ECDIS, GPS)** should not be on the same network as the **Crew Wi-Fi**. | Bridge Systems, Engine Control, Cargo Management, Crew/Admin Networks. |
| **2. Access Control** | Implement the **Principle of Least Privilege**. Users and systems should only have access to the information and functions necessary for their roles. Use strong, unique passwords and Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) where possible. | All IT and OT systems, physical access to server racks and bridge consoles. |
| **3. System Hardening** | Secure configurations of all devices. This includes changing default passwords, disabling unused ports and services, and removing unnecessary software. | PLCs, VDR, ECDIS, Satellite Comms units, Servers, Workstations. |
| **4. Patch Management** | Establish a robust process for testing and deploying security patches for all software and firmware. This is challenging at sea and requires a plan for remote deployment or application during port calls. | Operating Systems, ECDIS software, Firewall firmware, application software. |
| **5. Endpoint Protection** | Deploy and maintain up-to-date anti-virus and anti-malware software on all capable endpoints, such as admin PCs and workstations. | Shore-based systems, onboard administrative PCs. |
| **6. Secure Remote Access** | All remote access from shore-side (e.g., for vendor maintenance) must be through a secure, encrypted, and monitored channel like a VPN. Prohibit direct, unsecured connections (e.g., open RDP). | Engine monitoring systems, automation software, satellite communication equipment. |
| **7. Physical Security** | Control physical access to critical areas like the bridge, server room, and engine control room. Use locks, access logs, and even physical USB port blockers to prevent unauthorized device connections. | All critical hardware. |
| **8. Data Encryption** | Encrypt sensitive data both at rest (on hard drives) and in transit (over satellite or wireless networks) to prevent eavesdropping or data theft. | Voyage Data Recorder (VDR), administrative data, communications. |
| **9. GPS/GNSS Protection**| Deploy specialized receivers or software that can detect and alert on GPS spoofing and jamming attempts by cross-referencing multiple signal sources or detecting signal anomalies. | GPS, ECDIS, Dynamic Positioning Systems. |

### B. Procedural Protection Measures

These are policies, plans, and training programs focused on people and processes.

| Measure | Description | Implementation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. Cyber Security Governance** | Develop a formal **Cyber Security Policy** endorsed by senior management. This policy should align with international standards like the **IMO Resolution MSC.428(98)** and guidelines from BIMCO. | Create a written policy, assign roles and responsibilities (e.g., Cyber Security Officer). |
| **2. Risk Assessment** | Conduct regular risk assessments to identify, analyze, and evaluate cyber risks to the vessel and its operations. This involves creating an inventory of all critical IT and OT assets. | Annual or bi-annual assessments, documented in a risk register. |
| **3. Crew Training & Awareness**| The "human firewall" is the most critical defense. Conduct regular training on topics like phishing, social engineering, password hygiene, and safe use of removable media (USB drives). | Computer-based training, regular security bulletins, phishing simulation campaigns. |
| **4. Incident Response Plan** | Develop, maintain, and test a plan that details the specific steps to take in the event of a cyber attack. Who to call? How to isolate systems? How to recover? | Written plan stored in both digital and hard copy formats. Regular drills. |
| **5. Third-Party Management** | Vet the security practices of all third-party vendors, suppliers, and service providers who have access to the vessel's networks or data (e.g., equipment manufacturers, port agents). | Security clauses in contracts, vendor security questionnaires. |
| **6. Change Management** | Implement a formal process for managing any changes to IT or OT systems. All changes should be reviewed for potential security impacts before being approved and implemented. | Change request forms, approval workflows. |
| **7. Removable Media Policy** | Strictly control the use of USB drives and other removable media onboard. Prohibit the use of personal or un-scanned devices in critical systems. | Policy enforcement, providing crew with company-approved, scanned USB drives. |

## 2. Detection Measures (Identifying an Attack)

These are measures designed to identify a potential or active cyber incident in real-time or through forensic analysis.

### A. Technical Detection Measures

These are technologies used to monitor systems and networks for malicious activity.

| Measure | Description | Key Systems to Monitor |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)** | Deploy IDS sensors to monitor network traffic for known attack signatures or anomalous behavior that could indicate an intrusion. | Critical network segments (Bridge, Engine Room), perimeter firewalls. |
| **2. Centralized Logging & SIEM** | Collect logs from all critical systems (firewalls, servers, workstations, even OT devices if possible) into a centralized **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)** system. This allows for correlation of events across the network to detect complex attacks. | Firewalls, Windows/Linux Servers, Active Directory, network switches. |
| **3. Network & System Monitoring**| Continuously monitor the health and behavior of systems. An alert should be triggered if the **ECDIS CPU usage suddenly spikes**, or if a **navigation system tries to connect to an unknown internet IP address**. | All critical IT and OT assets. |
| **4. File Integrity Monitoring (FIM)** | Use software to monitor critical system files (e.g., electronic chart files, OS boot files) for unauthorized changes, which could indicate tampering. | ECDIS, Load planning computers, servers. |
| **5. Behavioral Anomaly Detection**| Utilize advanced tools (often AI/ML-based) that learn the "normal" operating baseline of OT systems. The system can then flag deviations, such as an engine receiving commands outside of its normal parameters. | Propulsion systems, ballast water systems, power management. |

### B. Procedural Detection Measures

These are human-driven activities aimed at discovering security weaknesses or active incidents.

| Measure | Description | Implementation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. Regular Log Review** | Designate a person or team (onboard or shore-side) to regularly review security logs and alerts generated by technical systems (SIEM, IDS, firewalls). An alert is useless if no one sees it. | Daily or weekly review checklists. |
| **2. Security Drills & Exercises** | Conduct regular drills that simulate cyber incidents, such as a **GPS spoofing attack** or a **ransomware outbreak**. This tests the effectiveness of both technical and procedural controls and the crew's response. | Tabletop exercises, live drills during calm seas or in port. |
| **3. Audits & Penetration Testing** | Periodically hire independent, certified ethical hackers to conduct penetration tests and vulnerability assessments of the vessel's systems to find weaknesses before attackers do. | Annual or bi-annual third-party testing. |
| **4. Clear Reporting Channels** | Establish a simple, no-blame process for crew members to report any suspicious activity, whether it's a strange email or unusual system behavior on the bridge. | A designated point of contact (e.g., Ship Security Officer) and a clear reporting procedure. |
| **5. Information Sharing** | Participate in industry information-sharing bodies like the **Maritime & Port Security Information Sharing and Analysis Organization (MPS-ISAO)**. This provides valuable intelligence on emerging threats and attacks targeting other vessels. | Membership and active participation in ISACs/ISAOs. |

### **Conclusion: A Continuous Cycle**

Maritime cyber security is not a one-time project but a continuous cycle of **Assess, Protect, Detect, Respond, and Recover**. By implementing a defense-in-depth strategy that combines robust technical measures with well-defined procedural controls, shipping companies can significantly reduce their risk and ensure the safety, security, and operational continuity of their fleet in an increasingly connected world.
