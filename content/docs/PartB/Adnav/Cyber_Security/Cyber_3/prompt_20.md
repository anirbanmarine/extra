### **Maritime Cyber Security: The Risk Assessment Process**

The International Maritime Organization (IMO) Resolution MSC.428(98) mandates that cyber risks be appropriately addressed in Safety Management Systems (SMS) no later than the first annual verification of the companyâ€™s Document of Compliance after January 1, 2021. The core of this compliance is a robust and continuous risk assessment process.

A maritime cyber risk assessment is not just about protecting data; it's about protecting the safety of the crew, the vessel, the cargo, and the marine environment. It recognizes the critical convergence of **Information Technology (IT)** and **Operational Technology (OT)** on modern vessels.

The process can be broken down into five key, cyclical steps, aligned with international standards like the NIST Cybersecurity Framework and the BIMCO Guidelines on Cyber Security Onboard Ships.
