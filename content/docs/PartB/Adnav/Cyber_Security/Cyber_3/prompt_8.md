Excellent topic. Monitoring is the cornerstone of any effective maritime cybersecurity strategy. It's the "detection" phase of the classic "Protect, Detect, Respond, Recover" framework and is critical for identifying threats before they cause significant damage.

Here is a detailed breakdown of maritime cybersecurity monitoring, covering what to monitor, how to do it, and the unique challenges involved.

### **Why is Maritime Cyber Monitoring Unique?**

Unlike a typical office environment, a modern vessel is a complex, isolated, and mobile ecosystem where Information Technology (IT) and Operational Technology (OT) are deeply converged. The stakes are incredibly high: a cyber-attack can impact not just data, but the physical safety of the crew, the vessel, the cargo, and the marine environment.

**Monitoring must account for this IT/OT convergence and the severe consequences of a breach.**

### **I. What to Monitor? The Maritime Attack Surface**

Monitoring must be holistic, covering all digital systems onboard and the connections to shore. This can be broken down into three key areas:

#### **A. Information Technology (IT) Systems**
These are the "business" and "welfare" systems. They are common entry points for attackers.
*   **Administrative Networks:** PCs used for port documentation, payroll, and general administration.
*   **Crew Welfare Networks:** The Wi-Fi and systems used by the crew for personal email, social media, and entertainment. Often a high-risk area.
*   **Email Servers & Communication:** Monitoring for phishing attempts, malware attachments, and suspicious links.
*   **File Servers & Cloud Storage:** Watching for unauthorized access, data exfiltration, or ransomware activity.

#### **B. Operational Technology (OT) Systems**
This is the heart of the vessel's operations. A compromise here has immediate physical consequences. These systems were often designed for reliability and efficiency, not security.
*   **Navigation Systems:**
    *   **ECDIS (Electronic Chart Display and Information System):** Monitor for unauthorized chart updates, route plan modifications, or system anomalies.
    *   **GPS/GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System):** Monitor for signal jamming (denial of service) or spoofing (providing false location data). This often requires specialized Radio Frequency (RF) sensors.
*   **Communication Systems:**
    *   **GMDSS (Global Maritime Distress and Safety System):** Ensure integrity and availability.
    *   **VSAT (Very Small Aperture Terminal) & FleetBroadband:** Monitor traffic for malicious communications, command-and-control (C2) channels, and large, unexpected data transfers.
*   **Propulsion and Machinery Control:**
    *   **Engine Control & Monitoring Systems:** Look for unusual commands, sensor reading anomalies, or unexpected shutdowns.
    *   **Power Management System (PMS):** Monitor for attempts to disrupt power distribution, which could lead to a blackout.
*   **Cargo and Ballast Management:**
    *   **Loading Computers:** Ensure the integrity of stability calculations.
    *   **Ballast Water Treatment Systems:** Monitor control systems for tampering.
*   **Safety & Security Systems:**
    *   **AIS (Automatic Identification System):** Monitor for spoofing (transmitting false vessel identity/location).
    *   **CCTV Systems:** Ensure they haven't been disabled or hijacked.

#### **C. Shore-Based & Vessel-to-Shore Systems**
The link between the vessel and the outside world is a critical monitoring point.
*   **Port Operations Systems:** When the vessel connects to the port network for cargo data exchange or services.
*   **Vessel Traffic Services (VTS):** Monitoring communications and data exchange with port authorities.
*   **Third-Party Maintenance Connections:** Remote access by vendors for diagnostics is a major potential vulnerability. Monitor these sessions closely.

### **II. How to Monitor? Tools and Processes**

Monitoring isn't just about having tools; it's about having a structured process to analyze the data they produce.

#### **1. Core Technology: SIEM & SOC**
*   **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM):** This is the central brain of a monitoring solution. A SIEM platform collects logs and event data from all the systems listed above (IT, OT, network devices). It then correlates this data to identify patterns, anomalies, and potential threats, generating alerts for security analysts.
*   **Security Operations Center (SOC):** This is the human team that analyzes the alerts from the SIEM. For maritime operators, a SOC can be:
    *   **In-house:** A dedicated team within the shipping company.
    *   **Managed (MSSP):** Outsourced to a third-party Managed Security Service Provider, often one specializing in maritime or OT.
    *   **Hybrid:** A mix of both.

#### **2. Key Monitoring Techniques**
*   **Network Monitoring (IDS/IPS):** Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) and Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS) are placed on the network to inspect traffic. They look for malicious signatures, protocol violations, and anomalous behavior between the IT and OT networks.
*   **Log Management:** Systematically collecting and analyzing logs from every critical device: firewalls, servers, ECDIS, engine controls, etc. The challenge is that many OT systems produce logs in proprietary formats that a SIEM may need special parsers for.
*   **Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR):** Deployed on IT endpoints (laptops, servers). EDR tools monitor for malicious processes, file changes, and behavior indicative of malware or an intruder.
*   **Vulnerability Scanning:** Regularly and automatically scanning systems for known vulnerabilities (like missing patches) so they can be fixed before an attacker exploits them.
*   **Threat Intelligence Integration:** Subscribing to threat intelligence feeds that provide information on the latest malware, phishing campaigns, and attack techniques specifically targeting the maritime industry. The SIEM uses this data to know what to look for.
*   **RF Spectrum Monitoring:** Using specialized sensors to detect GPS/GNSS jamming and spoofing attempts, which are invisible to traditional network monitoring tools.

### **III. The Major Challenges in Maritime Monitoring**

Monitoring in this environment is not straightforward.

*   **Connectivity:** Satellite communication (SATCOM) links are often low-bandwidth, high-latency, and expensive. Sending massive amounts of log data from the vessel to a shore-based SOC in real-time is often impractical. Solutions involve on-board data processing to send only critical alerts.
*   **Legacy OT Systems:** Many critical systems are old, run on unsupported operating systems (like Windows XP), and cannot have security software installed on them without voiding the warranty or risking operational failure. Monitoring these systems must be done passively on the network.
*   **The "Air Gap" Myth:** The belief that OT networks are completely isolated ("air-gapped") from IT networks is false. Maintenance laptops, USB drives, and interconnected systems create bridges for threats to cross.
*   **The Human Factor:** Crew members are not cybersecurity experts. Monitoring must account for unintentional errors, susceptibility to phishing, and the use of infected personal devices.
*   **Physical Access & Remote Response:** You can't just walk down to the server room. If an incident is detected, the ability to respond is limited by the skills of the crew onboard and the slow communication link to shore-based experts.

### **Regulatory Context**

Effective monitoring is no longer just a good idea; it's a requirement. **IMO Resolution MSC.428(98)** mandates that cyber risks be appropriately addressed in ship safety management systems (SMS) as of January 1, 2021. This implicitly requires the ability to detect cyber events. Classification societies and flag states now audit for this capability.

### **Conclusion**

Maritime cyber security monitoring is a specialized, multi-layered discipline. It requires a deep understanding of both IT and OT environments, tailored tools that can function within the constraints of a vessel, and a robust process managed by skilled analysts. By focusing on the full attack surface—from crew Wi-Fi to the engine room—shipping companies can move from a reactive to a proactive security posture, safeguarding their crew, vessel, and cargo in an increasingly connected world.
