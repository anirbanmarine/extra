### **Maritime Cyber Security Awareness: An Essential Guide**

Maritime Cyber Security Awareness is the understanding of cyber threats facing the maritime industry and the knowledge of how to prevent, detect, and respond to cyber incidents. It's not just for IT staff; it's a critical responsibility for everyone, from the seafarer on the bridge to the CEO in the head office.

The maritime industry's increasing reliance on digitalization, automation, and interconnected systems has transformed it into a prime target for cyber-attacks. The "human element" is consistently identified as the weakest link, making awareness the first and most crucial line of defense.

#### **Why is it So Critically Important?**

A cyber-attack in the maritime sector is not just an IT problem. It can have catastrophic real-world consequences.

*   **Safety:** An attack could compromise navigation systems (ECDIS, GPS), leading to collision, grounding, or loss of life. It could also disable safety systems or manipulate engine controls.
*   **Security:** Hackers could disable security systems to facilitate piracy, illegal trafficking, or terrorism. They could manipulate cargo manifests to steal high-value goods.
*   **Environmental:** A breach could cause a loss of containment by manipulating ballast water or fuel transfer systems, leading to a major environmental disaster and massive fines.
*   **Commercial & Financial:** The most common impact. This includes:
    *   **Ransomware:** Locking critical systems and demanding payment, as seen in the 2017 NotPetya attack on Maersk, which cost the company an estimated $300 million.
    *   **Business Disruption:** Halting port operations, delaying shipments, and breaking the global supply chain.
    *   **Financial Theft:** "Whaling" or "CEO Fraud" emails tricking staff into making fraudulent payments.
    *   **Reputational Damage:** Loss of customer trust and business partnerships.

#### **Common Threats & Vulnerabilities**

Awareness starts with knowing what to look for. These are the most common threats:

| Threat | Description & Maritime Example |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Phishing & Social Engineering** | Deceiving individuals into revealing sensitive information (passwords, credentials) or deploying malware. **Example:** A seafarer receives an email that looks like it's from a port agent asking for crew details, but the attached file contains malware. |
| **Malware & Ransomware** | Malicious software designed to disrupt operations, steal data, or extort money. **Example:** A contractor brings a personal laptop onboard to perform maintenance, and a virus spreads from their device to the ship's cargo planning system. |
| **Unsecured Removable Media** | The use of infected USB drives is a primary way malware gets onto isolated ship systems. **Example:** A crew member finds a "lost" USB drive in a port terminal and plugs it into a ship's computer out of curiosity, unknowingly installing a keylogger. |
| **GPS/AIS Spoofing & Jamming** | Transmitting false GPS or AIS (Automatic Identification System) signals to trick a vessel into thinking it's somewhere it isn't, potentially guiding it into dangerous waters or an ambush. |
| **Vulnerable OT Systems** | Operational Technology (OT) includes critical systems like propulsion, steering, ballast water, and navigation (ECDIS). These systems are often old, unpatched, and were not designed with security in mind. |
| **Lack of Network Segregation** | A flat network where the crew Wi-Fi, administrative computers, and critical OT systems are all connected. This allows an infection on a personal device to potentially spread to the ship's engine controls. |
| **Insider Threats** | Can be malicious (a disgruntled employee) or unintentional (an employee making a mistake). **Example:** An officer accidentally misconfigures a firewall rule, exposing the navigation system to the internet. |

#### **Building a Culture of Cyber Security Awareness**

Technology alone is not enough. A strong security culture is paramount. Hereâ€™s how to build it:

**1. Role-Based Training & Education**
Training should not be one-size-fits-all.

*   **For Seafarers (Onboard Crew):** Focus on operational risks.
    *   Safe use of USBs and personal devices.
    *   Identifying phishing emails.
    *   Protecting bridge and engine room systems.
    *   Physical security of terminals and access points.
    *   Procedures for reporting a suspected incident.
*   **For Shore-Based Personnel (Port, Logistics, Management):** Focus on business and data risks.
    *   Recognizing sophisticated phishing ("whaling").
    *   Secure data handling (cargo manifests, financial data).
    *   Vendor and third-party risk management.
    *   Incident response and communication plans.

**2. Clear Policies & Procedures**
Make the rules simple and accessible.
*   **Password Policy:** Mandate strong, unique passwords and multi-factor authentication (MFA).
*   **USB & Removable Media Policy:** Prohibit personal USBs. Sanction and scan all work-related USBs.
*   **Internet & Wi-Fi Usage Policy:** Segregate networks. Clarify what is acceptable use for crew and operational networks.
*   **Incident Reporting Procedure:** Create a simple, no-blame process for reporting anything suspicious immediately.

**3. Regular Drills and Simulations**
Knowledge must be tested.
*   **Phishing Simulations:** Send fake (but safe) phishing emails to staff to see who clicks. Use results to provide targeted retraining.
*   **Cyber Security Drills:** Run tabletop exercises that simulate a cyber-attack (e.g., "The GPS is showing us 20 miles off course, what do we do?"). This should be part of regular safety drills.

**4. Communication & Reinforcement**
*   **Visual Aids:** Place posters in crew messes, on the bridge, and in offices with simple reminders.
*   **Regular Updates:** Share news about recent maritime cyber-attacks to reinforce the reality of the threat.
*   **Leadership Buy-in:** When the Captain and senior management visibly prioritize cyber security, everyone else will follow.

#### **The Regulatory Imperative: IMO 2021**

Regulators have recognized the severity of the threat. The International Maritime Organization's (IMO) **Resolution MSC.428(98)** requires cyber risks to be appropriately addressed in ship safety management systems (SMS) under the ISM Code.

This means that ship owners and managers must:
*   Identify cyber risks to their ships.
*   Implement protective measures.
*   Have procedures for detecting and responding to incidents.

Compliance is checked during regular vessel audits by Flag States and Port State Control. A lack of awareness and procedure can lead to a vessel being detained.

### **Golden Rules for Every Individual**

If you remember nothing else, remember these five rules:

1.  **Think Before You Click:** If an email is unexpected or seems too good to be true, it probably is. Verify any unusual requests through a different channel (e.g., a phone call).
2.  **Be Wary of USBs:** Do not use personal or found USB drives on work systems. Assume every unknown device is infected.
3.  **Protect Your Credentials:** Use strong, unique passwords. Never share them. Log out of systems when you are finished.
4.  **Separate Work and Play:** Do not use work computers for personal activities like social media or gaming. Keep ship-critical systems isolated from crew welfare networks.
5.  **Report It!** If you see something suspicious or think you made a mistake, report it immediately. Reporting quickly can prevent a minor issue from becoming a major disaster.
