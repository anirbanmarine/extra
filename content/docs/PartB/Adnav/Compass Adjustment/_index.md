1. General principles of compass correction and the methods of finding and compensating for A. B. C, D and E types of deviation; 
2. Different methods of swinging ship to obtain a deviation table: relation of components P. and R and the rods a, b, c, d,e,f, g, h
and k to the various coefficients and to heeling error; 
3. Sextantal and octantal deviations; 
4. Use of the Kelvin deflector; 
5. Principle of the deflector method and its limitation;
6. Rules to be followed with regard to the.placing of correctors; 
7. "wiping" and degaussing; 
8. Construction of a curve of deviations and its practical use in coefficient analysis. 
9. Constant, semi-circular,and quadrantal deviation.
10. Analysis of a ship's deviation book to determine causes of irregular deviations and suggest measures for their removal. 
11. Analysis of a table of deviations.
12. Obtaining and explaining the approximate coefficients A, B, C, D and E.
