Excellent topic. This is a fundamental and critical area of knowledge for any mariner, as it directly relates to the use and accuracy of the magnetic compass for navigation.

Here is a comprehensive breakdown of Terrestrial and Ship's Magnetism.

---

### **Overview**

For safe navigation, a mariner needs to know their direction relative to **True North** (the direction of the geographic North Pole). A magnetic compass, however, does not point to True North. It is influenced by two primary magnetic fields:

1.  **Terrestrial Magnetism:** The Earth's own magnetic field.
2.  **Ship's Magnetism:** The magnetic field created by the ship itself.

Understanding and correcting for the effects of both is essential for accurate navigation.

### **Part 1: Terrestrial Magnetism (The Earth's Magnetism)**

The Earth behaves like a giant, imperfect magnet.

#### **1. The Source**
The Earth's magnetic field is believed to be generated by the **dynamo effect** in its molten outer core. The movement of liquid iron, driven by convection and the Earth's rotation, creates electrical currents, which in turn produce the magnetic field.

#### **2. Key Characteristics**
*   **Magnetic Poles:** The Earth has a North Magnetic Pole and a South Magnetic Pole. Crucially, **these are not in the same location as the geographic poles**. Furthermore, they wander over time.
*   **Magnetic Field Lines:** Lines of magnetic force flow from the South Magnetic Pole, around the Earth's surface, and into the North Magnetic Pole. A compass needle aligns itself with these lines of force.
*   **Horizontal and Vertical Components:** At any point on Earth, the magnetic field can be broken down into two components:
    *   **Horizontal Force (H):** This is the component that directs the compass needle to point north-south. It is strongest at the magnetic equator and weakest near the magnetic poles.
    *   **Vertical Force (Z) / Magnetic Dip:** This is the component that pulls the compass needle downwards (in the Northern Hemisphere) or upwards (in the Southern Hemisphere). This angle of "dip" is 0° at the magnetic equator and 90° at the magnetic poles. This force doesn't help with direction but can cause the compass card to tilt.

#### **3. The Navigational Error: Variation (or Declination)**
Because the magnetic and geographic poles are in different locations, a magnetic compass will not point to True North.

> **Variation** is the angle between the direction of **True North** and the direction of **Magnetic North** at a specific location on Earth.

*   It is named **East** or **West** depending on whether Magnetic North is to the east or west of True North.
*   Variation changes with geographic location and also changes slowly over time (secular change).
*   The value of variation for any given area is printed on nautical charts.
