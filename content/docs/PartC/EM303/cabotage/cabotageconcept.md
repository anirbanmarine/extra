Cabotage is the transportation of goods or passengers between two places in the same country by a foreign carrier. The term originated from the shipping industry, where it referred to coastal shipping. However, cabotage can now apply to all modes of transportation, including aviation, railways, and road transport.

Cabotage rights are the right of a foreign carrier to operate within the domestic borders of another country. Most countries have strict cabotage laws in place to protect their domestic transportation industries. However, there are some exceptions, such as the European Union, which allows for limited cabotage in the road freight sector.

### There are a number of reasons why countries may choose to restrict cabotage. These include:

* **Economic protectionism:** Countries may want to protect their domestic transportation industries from foreign competition.
* **National security:** Countries may want to ensure that their domestic transportation systems are controlled by domestic companies.
* **Public safety:** Countries may want to ensure that their transportation systems are regulated and operated to high safety standards.

Cabotage can have a number of economic and environmental benefits. For example, it can lead to lower transportation costs, increased competition, and reduced empty backhauls. However, it can also have some negative impacts, such as job losses in the domestic transportation industry.

### Here are some examples of cabotage:

* A foreign airline operating domestic flights within a country.
* A foreign shipping company transporting goods between two ports within a country.
* A foreign trucking company transporting goods between two cities within a country.

Cabotage is a complex issue with a number of economic, political, and social implications. It is important to carefully weigh the pros and cons of cabotage before making a decision about whether or not to allow it.
