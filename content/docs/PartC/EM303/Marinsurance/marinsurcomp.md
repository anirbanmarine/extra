* **Chief Financial Officer (CFO):** The CFO is responsible for the financial health of the company. They report to the CEO.
* **Chief Underwriting Officer (CUO):** The CUO is responsible for underwriting marine insurance policies. They assess the risk of each policy and set the premium.
* **Claims Manager:** The claims manager is responsible for handling claims from policyholders. They investigate claims and determine whether or not they are covered by the policy.
* **Sales and Marketing Manager:** The sales and marketing manager is responsible for generating new business for the company. They market the company's products and services to potential customers.


## In addition to these major departments, a marine insurance company may also have the following departments:

 Marine insurance companies play an important role in the maritime industry. They provide essential insurance coverage to shipowners and operators, which helps to protect businesses from the financial risks of loss or damage to vessels or cargo.

Marine insurance companies, like all insurance companies, are businesses that need to make a profit. They do this by charging premiums for their policies. The premium is based on the risk of loss or damage to the vessel or cargo. The higher the risk, the higher the premium.
