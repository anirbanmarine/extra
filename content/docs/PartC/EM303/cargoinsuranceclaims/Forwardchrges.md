Marine cargo insurance forwarding charges are the additional costs incurred by the cargo owner to forward their cargo to its destination following an insured loss or damage. These charges are typically covered by the marine cargo insurance policy, but there may be limits or exclusions.

## Some common examples of marine cargo insurance forwarding charges include:

* **Unloading and storage charges:** These charges may be incurred if the cargo needs to be unloaded from the vessel and stored before it can be forwarded to its destination.
* **Onward transportation charges:** These charges cover the cost of transporting the cargo from the port of discharge to its final destination.
* **Customs clearance charges:** These charges may be incurred if the cargo needs to be cleared through customs before it can be forwarded to its destination.
* **Survey fees and reconditioning costs:** These charges may be incurred if the cargo needs to be surveyed or reconditioned before it can be forwarded to its destination.
* **Sue and labor expenses:** These are expenses incurred to avert or minimize a loss from an insured peril.

To be covered by marine cargo insurance, forwarding charges must be properly and reasonably incurred. The cargo owner must also be able to provide evidence of the charges incurred.
