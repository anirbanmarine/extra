The specific exclusions of a war risk insurance policy will vary depending on the provider and the policy itself. However, some common exclusions include:

* **Losses caused by war, terrorism, or civil unrest that occur in a country that is specifically excluded from the policy.**
* **Losses caused by war, terrorism, or civil unrest that occur within a certain distance of a conflict zone.**
* **Losses caused by war, terrorism, or civil unrest that occur to certain types of property, such as contraband or nuclear weapons.**
* **Losses caused by war, terrorism, or civil unrest that occur as a result of the insured's own negligence.**

It is important to carefully review the exclusions of a war risk insurance policy before purchasing it. This will help to ensure that you are aware of the limitations of the policy and that you are not covered for losses that you may think are covered.

Here are some examples of current exclusions from war risk insurance policies:

* **The war in Ukraine is excluded from many war risk insurance policies.** This means that businesses that operate in or ship goods to Ukraine are not covered for losses caused by the war.
* **The civil war in Syria is also excluded from many war risk insurance policies.** This means that businesses that operate in or ship goods to Syria are not covered for losses caused by the war.
* **The terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, are excluded from many war risk insurance policies.** This means that businesses that were affected by the attacks are not covered for losses caused by the attacks.

It is important to note that these are just a few examples, and the specific exclusions of a war risk insurance policy will vary depending on the provider and the policy itself.
