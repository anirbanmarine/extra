Ports are essential nodes in the global transportation network, connecting ships, trains, trucks, and airplanes. They play a vital role in trade and economic development by facilitating the movement of goods and people.

## **Hub ports**

Hub ports are large, high-volume ports that serve as major gateways for global trade. They are typically located in strategic locations along major shipping routes and have the capacity to handle a wide variety of cargo. Hub ports often serve as feeder ports for smaller ports in the region.

### **Feeder or transshipment ports**

Feeder ports are smaller ports that connect to hub ports by ship. They collect cargo from smaller ports and nearby areas and transport it to hub ports for consolidation and onward shipment to other parts of the world. Feeder ports also play an important role in distributing cargo from hub ports to smaller ports and inland areas.

### **Intermodal interfaces**

Intermodal interfaces are transportation hubs that connect different modes of transportation, such as ships, trains, trucks, and airplanes. They play an important role in facilitating the efficient movement of goods between different modes of transportation. Intermodal interfaces often have facilities for storing and handling cargo, as well as for transloading cargo from one mode of transportation to another.

### **Examples of ports by function**

* **Hub ports:** New York, Los Angeles, Singapore, Shanghai, Rotterdam
* **Feeder or transshipment ports:** Hong Kong, Dubai, Busan, Jeddah
* **Intermodal interfaces:** Long Beach, Houston, Chicago

## Conclusion

Ports play a vital role in the global economy by facilitating the movement of goods and people. Hub ports, feeder ports, and intermodal interfaces all play different but important roles in the global transportation network.
