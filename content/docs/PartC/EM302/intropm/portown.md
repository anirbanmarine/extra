## Public ports

Public ports are owned and operated by the government. The government may be responsible for all aspects of port management, including infrastructure development, cargo handling, and marketing. Public ports are typically subject to government regulation, and their rates and services are often subsidized.

Examples of public ports include:

* Port of Los Angeles, California
* Port of New York and New Jersey
* Port of Rotterdam, Netherlands

## Private ports

Private ports are owned and operated by private companies. Private ports may be fully or partially privatized. Fully privatized ports are owned by private companies and operate with little or no government involvement. Partially privatized ports may be owned by a combination of public and private entities.

Examples of private ports include:

* Port of Dubai, United Arab Emirates
* Port of Singapore
* Port of Gioia Tauro, Italy

##  Landlord ports

Landlord ports are a hybrid form of port ownership that combines elements of public and private ownership. In a landlord port, the government owns the port land and infrastructure, but leases it to private companies to operate. The private companies are responsible for building and operating cargo terminals, warehouses, and other port facilities.

Examples of landlord ports include:

* Port of Hong Kong
* Port of Tanjung Priok, Indonesia
* Port of Piraeus, Greece

### Full or part service provider terminal facilities within ports

Terminal facilities within ports can be owned and operated by a variety of entities, including the port authority, private companies, or joint ventures. Some terminal facilities may be fully owned and operated by a single entity, while others may be partially owned and operated by multiple entities.

Examples of full or part service provider terminal facilities within ports include:

* Container terminal operated by MSC (private company) at the Port of Piraeus, Greece
* Ro-Ro terminal operated by PSA (joint venture between the Singapore government and PSA International) at the Port of Algeciras, Spain
* Dry bulk terminal operated by APM Terminals (private company) at the Port of Rotterdam, Netherlands

### Conclusion

There are a variety of ownership structures for ports and port services. The specific structure that is used in a particular port will depend on a number of factors, including the country's economic system, the port's strategic importance, and the level of government involvement desired.
