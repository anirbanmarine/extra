| **Carrier’s Liability Basis** | Fault-based (carrier liable only if negligent). | Similar to Hague Rules with minor adjustments. | Strict liability (carrier liable unless proving all reasonable measures taken). | Modified fault-based system (carrier liable unless proving no fault). |
| **Period of Responsibility** | "Tackle to Tackle" (loading to discharge). | Same as Hague Rules. | "Port to Port" (receipt to delivery at port). | "Door-to-Door" (entire transport period, including land legs if part of contract). |
| **Limitation of Liability** | £100 per package or unit. | **666.67 SDR per package** or **2 SDR per kg**, whichever is higher. | **835 SDR per package** or **2.5 SDR per kg**, whichever is higher. | **875 SDR per package** or **3 SDR per kg**, whichever is higher. |
| **Defenses for Carrier** | Broad (nautical fault, fire exemption). | Similar to Hague Rules. | Fewer defenses (no nautical fault exemption). | More balanced defenses, but excludes "nautical fault" exemption. |
| **Time Bar for Claims** | 1 year from delivery. | 1 year (same as Hague). | 2 years from delivery. | 2 years (extendable by agreement). |
| **Notice of Loss/Damage** | 3 days (apparent damage). | Same as Hague. | 15 days (non-apparent damage). | 7 days (apparent), 21 days (non-apparent). |
| **Effect on Third Parties** | Only shipper-carrier relationship. | Extends to some third parties (e.g., actual carriers). | Broader third-party application. | Explicitly covers performing parties (subcontractors). |
| **Electronic Documentation** | No provision. | No provision. | No provision. | **Explicitly recognizes e-documents** (e-BoLs). |
| **Adoption & Popularity** | Outdated but historically significant. | **Most widely adopted** (amended Hague Rules). | Limited (mostly developing nations). | **Not widely ratified yet** (only a few countries). |

### **Key Observations:**
1. **Hague-Visby Rules** remain the most widely used, balancing carrier and shipper interests.  
2. **Hamburg Rules** favor cargo owners but lack global acceptance.  
3. **Rotterdam Rules** are the most modern, covering e-docs and multimodal transport, but adoption is slow.  
4. **Liability limits increase progressively** from Hague → Hague-Visby → Hamburg → Rotterdam.
