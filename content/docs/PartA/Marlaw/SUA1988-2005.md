### **1. Scope and Applicability**
- **Targets unlawful acts**: Covers acts like hijacking ships, violence against passengers/crew, damaging ships or cargo, and placing destructive devices on board .
- **Exclusions**: Does not apply to warships, state-operated ships (e.g., naval auxiliaries, customs/police vessels), or ships withdrawn from service .

---

### **2. Key Offenses**
The SUA Convention criminalizes:
- **Seizure of ships by force** or intimidation.
- **Acts of violence** endangering ship safety (e.g., harming crew/passengers).
- **Destruction or damage** to ships, cargo, or navigational facilities.
- **False communication** threatening navigation safety.
- **Transport of WMDs**: The 2005 Protocol expanded offenses to include transporting biological, chemical, or nuclear (BCN) weapons, hazardous materials, or equipment for WMD production .
- **Terrorist-linked acts**: Using ships to intimidate populations or coerce governments (e.g., discharging explosives or hazardous substances) .

---

### **3. Jurisdiction and Enforcement**
- **Flag state jurisdiction**: States must prosecute or extradite offenders if the crime involves their flagged ship, occurs in their territory, or is committed by their nationals .
- **Boarding provisions**: The 2005 Protocol allows states to request boarding of suspect ships with the flag state’s consent, including a "no-response" clause permitting boarding after 4 hours if the flag state fails to reply .
- **Safeguards**: Boarding must respect human rights, avoid undue delay, and minimize environmental harm .

---

### **4. Extradition and Legal Cooperation**
- **Aut dedere aut judicare**: States must either prosecute offenders or extradite them to a requesting state .
- **Non-political offenses**: Crimes under the SUA Convention cannot be classified as political offenses to block extradition .
- **Mutual legal assistance**: States must cooperate in investigations and evidence sharing .

---

### **5. 2005 Protocol Enhancements**
- **New offenses**: Added crimes like transporting WMD-related materials and using ships as weapons .
- **Fixed platforms**: The related Protocol for Fixed Platforms criminalizes similar acts against offshore installations .
- **Corporate liability**: Holds legal entities (e.g., companies) accountable for offenses committed by their management .

---

### **6. Relationship with Other Treaties**
- **Linked to anti-terrorism treaties**: The SUA Convention’s Annex references nine other treaties (e.g., Hague Hijacking Convention, Terrorist Bombings Convention) to broaden jurisdictional grounds .

---

### **7. Implementation in National Law**
- **Domestic legislation required**: States must incorporate SUA offenses into local laws with "appropriate penalties" . For example, the U.S. codified SUA crimes under 18 U.S. Code § 2280, prescribing penalties up to life imprisonment .

---

### **Conclusion**
The SUA Convention and its 2005 Protocol provide a comprehensive legal framework to combat maritime terrorism, WMD proliferation, and other threats. By mandating prosecution/extradition, enabling cooperative boarding, and expanding offenses, it strengthens global maritime security . As of 2024, 166 states are parties, covering 94.5% of global merchant tonnage .
