The **Athens Convention relating to the Carriage of Passengers and their Luggage by Sea (1974)** is an international maritime treaty that establishes liability rules for passenger injuries, deaths, and luggage loss or damage during sea travel. Here are its **salient features**:

### **1. Scope of Application**  
- Applies to **international carriage** of passengers by sea on ships registered in a contracting state or under a contracting state’s law.  
- Covers **commercial voyages**, including cruises and ferries, but may exclude domestic transport under national laws.  

### **2. Liability for Passenger Death/Injury**  
- **Strict Liability (Presumed Fault)**:  
  - The carrier is **automatically liable** for passenger injury or death up to a **financial limit**, unless they prove the incident resulted from:  
    - An act of war/natural disaster (*force majeure*),  
    - The passenger’s own negligence, or  
    - A third party’s intentional act.  
- **Higher Liability for Negligence**:  
  - If the carrier is proven **negligent**, liability limits may be exceeded.  

### **3. Compensation Limits (as amended by the 2002 Protocol)**  
- **Death or Injury**: **250,000 SDR** (Special Drawing Rights, ~USD 330,000) per passenger.  
- **Luggage Loss/Damage**:  
  - **Cabin Luggage**: 2,250 SDR (~USD 3,000)  
  - **Vehicles & Contents**: 12,700 SDR (~USD 17,000)  
  - **Other Luggage**: 3,375 SDR (~USD 4,500)  

### **4. Mandatory Insurance Requirement (2002 Protocol)**  
- Carriers must maintain **insurance or financial security** (e.g., P&I Club coverage) to cover claims.  
- **Direct Action**: Passengers can sue insurers directly.  

### **5. Time Limits for Claims**  
- **Injury/Death**: **2 years** from disembarkation or incident (whichever is later).  
- **Luggage Claims**: **15 days** for apparent damage; **60 days** for non-apparent damage.  

### **6. Defenses Available to Carriers**  
- **Contributory Negligence**: Compensation may be reduced if the passenger’s actions contributed to the harm.  
- **Force Majeure**: No liability for unforeseeable events like wars or natural disasters.  

### **7. Jurisdiction & Enforcement**  
- Claims can be filed in:  
  - The carrier’s principal place of business,  
  - The place of departure/destination, or  
  - The passenger’s habitual residence (if the carrier operates there).  

### **8. 2002 Protocol (Athens Convention 2002)**  
- Introduced **stricter liability**, **higher compensation limits**, and **mandatory insurance**.  
- Adopted after the **MS Estonia sinking (1994)** to enhance passenger protection.  

### **Significance**  
- Provides **uniform liability rules** for passenger claims, balancing carrier responsibilities and passenger rights.  
- Many countries (including EU members) have ratified the **2002 Protocol**, while others follow the original 1974 version.
