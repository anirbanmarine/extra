International criminal law addresses some of the most serious violations of international law. Here's a breakdown of the crimes you mentioned:

**Piracy**

*   **Definition:** Piracy is an act of violence or detention committed for private ends by the crew or passengers of a private ship or aircraft on the high seas against another ship or aircraft, or against persons or property on board.
*   **International Law:** The United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) defines piracy and establishes the principle of universal jurisdiction, meaning any country can prosecute pirates, regardless of where the crime occurred or the nationality of the pirates.
*   **Key Elements:**
    *   An illegal act of violence or detention, or any act of depredation.
    *   Committed for private ends.
    *   By a private ship or aircraft.
    *   On the high seas (outside the territorial waters of any nation).

**Armed Robbery**

*   **Definition:** Armed robbery, in the context of international law, typically refers to robbery at sea within a state's internal waters, archipelagic waters, and territorial sea. It's similar to piracy but occurs in waters under a nation's jurisdiction.
*   **International Law:** While not subject to universal jurisdiction like piracy, armed robbery is still a serious crime that states are obligated to address through national laws and international cooperation.
*   **Key Elements:**
    *   An illegal act of violence or detention, or any act of depredation, or threat thereof.
    *   Committed for private ends.
    *   Directed against a ship or persons or property on board.
    *   Within a state's internal waters, archipelagic waters, and territorial sea.

**Criminal Trespass**

*   **Definition:** Criminal trespass generally refers to the intentional intrusion on or interference with the property of another without any legal justification or the consent of the person legally entitled to possession of the property.
*   **International Law:** Criminal trespass is typically dealt with under national laws. However, if it occurs in the context of other international crimes, such as during an armed conflict or as part of a widespread attack against a civilian population, it could potentially fall under international criminal law.

**Crimes Against Humanity**

*   **Definition:** Crimes against humanity are widespread or systematic attacks directed against any civilian population, with knowledge of the attack.
*   **International Law:** The Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court (ICC) defines crimes against humanity and establishes the ICC's jurisdiction over such crimes.
*   **Key Elements:**
    *   A widespread or systematic attack.
    *   Directed against a civilian population.
    *   With knowledge of the attack.
    *   Specific acts, including:
        *   Murder
        *   Extermination
        *   Enslavement
        *   Deportation or forcible transfer of population
        *   Imprisonment or other severe deprivation of physical liberty
        *   Torture
        *   Rape, sexual slavery, forced prostitution, forced pregnancy, forced sterilization, or any other form of sexual violence of comparable gravity
        *   Persecution against any identifiable group on political, racial, national, ethnic, cultural, religious, gender, or other grounds
        *   Enforced disappearance of persons
        *   The crime of apartheid
        *   Other inhumane acts of a similar character intentionally causing great suffering or serious injury to body or mental or physical health

**Important Notes:**

*   **Jurisdiction:** International criminal law operates alongside national laws. The ICC has jurisdiction over individuals for the most serious crimes of international concern when national courts are unwilling or unable genuinely to investigate or prosecute such crimes.
*   **Individual Criminal Responsibility:** International criminal law emphasizes individual criminal responsibility, meaning individuals can be held liable for their actions, even if they acted on orders from a superior.
*   **Evolution of International Law:** International criminal law is constantly evolving, with new treaties and judicial decisions shaping its scope and application.

This information provides a general overview. It is essential to consult specific treaties, legal instruments, and case law for a comprehensive understanding of international criminal law.
