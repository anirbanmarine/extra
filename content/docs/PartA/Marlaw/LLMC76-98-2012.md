The Convention on Limitation of Liability for Maritime Claims (LLMC) 1976, along with its amendments in 1996 and 2012, establishes a legal framework that allows shipowners and salvors to limit their liability for certain maritime claims. Here are the salient features of this convention as amended:

**Core Principles:**

* **Right to Limit Liability:** Shipowners, charterers, managers, operators, and salvors can limit their liability for claims arising from maritime incidents. This encourages investment in shipping by providing a degree of financial protection.
* **Claims Subject to Limitation:** The Convention applies to a wide range of claims, including:
    * Loss of life or personal injury.
    * Loss of or damage to property (including damage to harbor works, basins, and waterways).
    * Consequential loss resulting from the above.
    * Claims for expenses incurred in raising, removing, destroying, or rendering harmless a wrecked, sunken, stranded, or abandoned ship and its cargo.
    * Claims in respect of measures taken to avert or minimize loss for which the person liable may limit liability.
* **Unbreakable System of Limitation:** The right to limit liability is virtually unbreakable. A person liable cannot limit their liability only if it is proven that the loss resulted from their personal act or omission, committed with the intent to cause such loss, or recklessly and with knowledge that such loss would probably result (Article 4).
* **Tonnage-Based Limitation:** The limits of liability are generally calculated based on the tonnage of the ship. Separate limits are established for claims involving loss of life or personal injury and other claims (property damage, etc.).
* **Special Drawing Rights (SDR):** The unit of account used for setting the limits of liability is the Special Drawing Right, as defined by the International Monetary Fund. This provides a stable international currency for the limits.
* **Constitution of a Limitation Fund:** A person entitled to limit liability can constitute a fund in a court of a contracting state where the claim is brought. The amount of the fund is calculated according to the limits set by the Convention.

**Key Amendments:**

* **1996 Protocol:**
    * **Increased Limits:** The 1996 Protocol significantly increased the limits of liability compared to the original 1976 Convention, providing greater compensation for claimants. For example, the limit for loss of life or personal injury for ships not exceeding 2,000 gross tonnage was raised to 2 million SDR.
    * **Tacit Acceptance Procedure:** This protocol introduced a "tacit acceptance" procedure for updating the limitation amounts. This simplified the process for future amendments.
    * **Extension of Scope:** The definition of "shipowner" was broadened to include managers and operators.
* **2012 Amendments:**
    * **Further Increased Limits:** Prompted by significant pollution incidents, the 2012 amendments further increased the limitation amounts set in the 1996 Protocol. For instance, the limit of liability for claims for loss of life or personal injury on ships not exceeding 2,000 gross tonnage rose to 3.02 million SDR. The additional amounts for larger ships were also increased proportionally.
    * **Entry into Force:** These amendments entered into force on June 8, 2015, following the tacit acceptance procedure.

**Impact of Amendments:**

The amendments, particularly those in 1996 and 2012, have significantly enhanced the compensation available to victims of maritime accidents while maintaining a system that allows shipowners and salvors to manage their potential liabilities. The tacit acceptance procedure ensures that the limits can be updated more efficiently in the future to reflect changes in economic conditions and the cost of claims.

In essence, the LLMC 1976, as amended, strikes a balance between protecting the interests of potential claimants by providing adequate compensation and ensuring the financial viability of the shipping and salvage industries by allowing for the limitation of liability.
