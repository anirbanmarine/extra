The Indian Limitation Act, 1963 is a crucial piece of procedural law that prescribes time limits within which various legal actions, such as suits, appeals, and applications, must be initiated in courts. Its primary objective is to ensure that disputes are brought before the court in a timely manner, preventing the revival of stale claims and promoting legal certainty. Here are the salient features of the Indian Limitation Act, 1963:

**1. Prescription of Time Limits:**
   - The Act provides a specific **period of limitation** for different types of legal actions, as detailed in the Schedule to the Act. These periods vary depending on the nature of the suit, appeal, or application.
   - For instance, suits relating to recovery of money or breach of contract generally have a limitation period of **three years**, while suits for possession of immovable property often have a period of **twelve years**. Appeals and certain applications have shorter limitation periods, typically ranging from **30 to 90 days**.

**2. Bar of Limitation:**
   - **Section 3** of the Act explicitly states that any suit, appeal, or application instituted after the prescribed period of limitation shall be **dismissed** by the court, even if the defendant or respondent has not raised the plea of limitation. This makes it a mandatory duty of the court to consider the limitation period.

**3. Commencement of Limitation Period:**
   - The Act specifies the **starting point** from which the limitation period begins to run for different types of cases. Generally, the limitation period commences when the **right to sue accrues** or when the applicant has the right to make the application.

**4. Exclusion of Time in Certain Circumstances:**
   - The Act provides for the **exclusion of certain periods** while computing the limitation period. These include:
     - Time spent prosecuting the same case in a wrong court (due to lack of jurisdiction).
     - Time taken for obtaining copies of decrees, orders, or judgments.
     - Time during which legal proceedings were stayed by an injunction or order.
     - Time during which the plaintiff or applicant was under a legal disability (e.g., minority, insanity).

**5. Extension of Limitation Period:**
   - **Section 5** of the Act empowers the court to **extend the prescribed period of limitation** if the appellant or applicant satisfies the court that they had **sufficient cause** for not preferring the appeal or making the application within such period. The explanation to this section clarifies that being misled by an order, practice, or judgment of the High Court in computing the period can be a sufficient cause.

**6. Legal Disability:**
   - **Sections 6, 7, and 8** deal with the effect of **legal disability** (minority, insanity, or idiocy) on the limitation period. Generally, where a person entitled to institute a suit or make an application is under a legal disability, the limitation period does not begin to run until the disability has ceased.

**7. Acknowledgment of Liability:**
   - **Section 18** provides that if a person acknowledges their liability in respect of any property or right in writing, signed before the expiration of the prescribed period, a **fresh period of limitation** shall be computed from the date of such acknowledgment.

**8. Part Payment of Debt or Interest:**
   - **Section 19** states that where payment on account of a debt or interest on a legacy is made before the expiration of the prescribed period by the person liable to pay, a **fresh period of limitation** shall be computed from the time when the payment was made.

**9. Effect of Death:**
   - **Section 16** deals with the effect of the death of a plaintiff or defendant before the accrual of the right to sue or after the accrual but before the expiry of the limitation period. It provides for the exclusion of certain periods in such cases.

**10. Fraud or Mistake:**
    - **Section 17** states that where a suit or application is based upon fraud or mistake, the period of limitation shall not begin to run until the plaintiff or applicant has discovered the fraud or mistake, or could with reasonable diligence have discovered it.

**11. Acquisition of Ownership by Possession (Adverse Possession):**
    - **Part IV (Sections 25-27)** deals with the acquisition of ownership of immovable property by **adverse possession** over a continuous period of **twelve years** against a private owner and **thirty years** against the government. Section 27 also provides for the extinguishment of the right to property if a suit for possession is not brought within the prescribed period.

**12. Limitation Does Not Bar Defence:**
    - A significant principle is that the law of limitation **bars the remedy but does not extinguish the right**, except in cases of adverse possession. Therefore, a defendant can still raise a time-barred right as a defense in a suit.

**13. Application to Suits, Appeals, and Applications:**
    - The Act applies to all **civil suits, appeals, and certain applications** in courts. It does not generally apply to criminal proceedings, except where specifically provided.

**14. Procedural Law:**
    - The Limitation Act is generally considered a **procedural law**, as it governs the procedure for enforcing rights rather than creating substantive rights. Procedural laws are typically retrospective in their operation.

**15. Based on Public Policy:**
    - The Act is based on the principles that it is in the interest of the state to have an end to litigation (**"interest reipublicae ut sit finis litium"**) and that the law aids the vigilant and not the indolent (**"vigilantibus non dormientibus jura subveniunt"**).

These salient features highlight the importance of the Indian Limitation Act, 1963 in ensuring the timely administration of justice and preventing the perpetuation of legal disputes indefinitely. It balances the need to provide remedies to aggrieved parties with the necessity of bringing finality to legal proceedings.
