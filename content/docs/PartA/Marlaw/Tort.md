## Definition

a **tort** is indeed a **civil wrong** that results in **harm or injury** to another person, and this gives the injured party the right to seek legal remedies, typically in the form of **damages** (monetary compensation) from the person or entity responsible.

To expand slightly, here are a few key aspects to keep in mind about torts:

* **Civil vs. Criminal:** Torts fall under civil law, meaning the injured party (plaintiff) brings a lawsuit against the wrongdoer (defendant). This is different from criminal law, where the state prosecutes an individual for violating a law. Sometimes, the same action can be both a tort and a crime.
* **Variety of Wrongs:** The realm of tort law is broad and encompasses many different types of wrongful acts, including:
    * **Negligence:** This is the most common type of tort and occurs when someone fails to exercise the reasonable care that a prudent person would under similar circumstances, leading to injury (e.g., car accidents, slip-and-fall cases).
    * **Intentional Torts:** These involve deliberate actions that cause harm (e.g., assault, battery, defamation, trespass).
    * **Strict Liability Torts:** In certain situations, a person or entity can be held liable for harm caused by their actions regardless of fault or intent (e.g., abnormally dangerous activities, defective products).
* **Focus on Compensation:** The primary goal of tort law is to compensate the injured party for their losses, which can include medical expenses, lost income, pain and suffering, and property damage. In some cases, punitive damages may also be awarded to punish the defendant for particularly egregious conduct.
* **Legal Duty:** Often, a tort arises when one person or entity has a legal duty to another and breaches that duty, causing harm. For example, drivers have a duty to operate their vehicles safely.

Understanding the basic principle of tort law is fundamental to grasping a significant area of the legal system that affects individuals and businesses daily.
