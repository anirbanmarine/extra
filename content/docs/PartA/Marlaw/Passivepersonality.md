The principle of **Passive Personality Jurisdiction** in international law allows a state to assert criminal jurisdiction over individuals who commit crimes against its nationals, even if those crimes occur outside the state's territory. In essence, the jurisdiction is based on the **nationality of the victim**.

Here's a breakdown of the key aspects of this principle:

* **Focus on the Victim's Nationality:** Unlike territorial jurisdiction (where the crime occurs) or active personality jurisdiction (where the perpetrator is a national of the prosecuting state), passive personality jurisdiction centers on the nationality of the person harmed by the crime.
* **Extraterritorial Application:** This principle allows a state to reach beyond its borders to prosecute offenses committed elsewhere, provided the victim is one of its nationals.
* **Controversial Basis of Jurisdiction:** Passive personality jurisdiction is one of the more controversial bases of extraterritorial jurisdiction. Concerns often raised include:
    * **Infringement on Sovereignty:** Critics argue that it unduly extends a state's legal reach into the territory of other sovereign states.
    * **Lack of Foreseeability:** Individuals might be subject to the laws of a foreign state based solely on the victim's nationality, which they may not be aware of.
    * **Potential for Abuse:** There's a risk that states might use this principle to assert jurisdiction over matters with tenuous links to their national interests.
* **Increasing Acceptance in Specific Contexts:** Despite the criticisms, the principle has gained increasing, though not universal, acceptance in certain areas, particularly concerning:
    * **Terrorism:** States often invoke this principle when their nationals are victims of terrorist acts committed abroad.
    * **Cybercrime:** With the borderless nature of cyber offenses, some states use it when their citizens are targeted by cybercriminals operating from other countries.
    * **Crimes Against Nationals Abroad:** In cases where a state feels the local jurisdiction is inadequate or unwilling to prosecute crimes against its citizens, it might resort to passive personality jurisdiction.
* **Limitations and Safeguards:** States that employ this principle often do so with certain limitations, such as requiring the crime to be serious under their own laws and sometimes under the laws of the state where it occurred (the principle of double criminality). International comity and the sovereignty of other states are also considerations.

**Examples:**

* **United States v. Yunis (1988):** The US asserted jurisdiction over a Lebanese national who hijacked a Jordanian airliner with US citizens on board, based on the passive personality principle.
* **France's Prosecution of the Murder of Sophie Toscan du Plantier:** France pursued the prosecution of a British national in an Irish court for the murder of a French citizen in Ireland, relying on passive personality jurisdiction (though extradition was ultimately denied).
* **Cybercrime Legislation:** Some countries have laws that allow them to prosecute individuals in other countries who commit cybercrimes targeting their citizens.

In conclusion, the principle of passive personality jurisdiction is a basis for asserting extraterritorial criminal jurisdiction based on the victim's nationality. While controversial, it is increasingly invoked in specific transnational crime contexts, particularly where a state seeks to protect its citizens from harm abroad. Its application remains subject to debates about state sovereignty and the need for limitations to prevent abuse.
