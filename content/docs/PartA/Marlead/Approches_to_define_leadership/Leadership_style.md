*   **Characteristics:**
    *   Strong communication skills
    *   Visionary outlook
    *   Confidence and self-assuredness
    *   Ability to connect with people on an emotional level
*   **Potential Downsides:** Can create dependence on the leader; risk of "cult of personality"

**2. Visionary Leadership**

*   **Focus:** Leaders articulate a clear and compelling vision for the future and inspire others to work towards it.
*   **Characteristics:**
    *   Forward-thinking and strategic
    *   Excellent communication skills to convey the vision
    *   Passionate and enthusiastic
    *   Ability to motivate and inspire
*   **Example:** Steve Jobs with Apple

**3. Autocratic Leadership**

*   **Focus:** Leaders make decisions independently with little to no input from others.
*   **Characteristics:**
    *   Centralized authority
    *   Clear directives and expectations
    *   Close supervision
    *   Can be efficient in certain situations (e.g., emergencies)
*   **Potential Downsides:** Can stifle creativity and lower morale

**4. Entrepreneurial Leadership**

*   **Focus:** Leaders are innovative, risk-taking, and driven to create new opportunities.
*   **Characteristics:**
    *   Visionary and creative
    *   Proactive and adaptable
    *   Decisive and action-oriented
    *   Comfortable with uncertainty
*   **Often found in:** Startups and rapidly growing companies

**5. Contingency Leadership**

*   **Focus:** The most effective leadership style depends on the situation.
*   **Key Idea:** Leaders adapt their approach based on factors like:
    *   The task at hand
    *   The skills and experience of followers
    *   The organizational culture
*   **Example:** A leader might be more directive in a crisis but more delegative with a highly skilled team.

**Important Note:** It's rare for a leader to fit perfectly into just one of these styles. Most leaders use a blend of approaches depending on the context.

**Here are a few more common leadership styles to give you a broader picture:**

*   **Transformational Leadership:** Inspires significant change in followers and organizations (often overlaps with charismatic and visionary).
*   **Transactional Leadership:** Focuses on exchanges between leaders and followers (e.g., rewards for performance).
*   **Democratic/Participative Leadership:** Involves followers in decision-making.
*   **Laissez-faire Leadership:** Provides little to no direction to followers (can be effective with highly skilled and motivated teams, but can also lead to chaos).
*   **Servant Leadership:** Prioritizes the needs of followers and empowers them.

Understanding these different leadership styles can help you identify your own tendencies and become a more effective leader by adapting your approach to different situations and people.
