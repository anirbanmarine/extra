While there's ongoing debate and some overlap, it's generally accepted that **management is a subset of leadership.** Here's why:

**Leadership:**

*   **Focus:** Inspiring and influencing people towards a shared vision. It's about setting direction, creating a culture, and motivating individuals to achieve extraordinary results.
*   **Key Aspects:** Vision, inspiration, motivation, change, and people-centric.

**Management:**

*   **Focus:** Planning, organizing, and controlling resources to achieve specific goals. It's about efficiency, processes, and ensuring things run smoothly.
*   **Key Aspects:** Planning, organizing, directing, controlling, and task-oriented.

**Here's how management fits within leadership:**

1.  **Leadership sets the direction; management figures out how to get there.** Leaders create the vision and inspire people to pursue it. Managers then develop the plans, structures, and processes to make that vision a reality.

2.  **Leadership is about people; management is about systems.** Leaders focus on motivating and empowering individuals, while managers focus on creating efficient systems and processes.

3.  **Leadership drives change; management maintains stability.** Leaders challenge the status quo and inspire innovation, while managers ensure that day-to-day operations run smoothly.

**Think of it this way:**

*   **Leaders** are like architects who design the building and inspire the construction crew.
*   **Managers** are like the construction foreman who organizes the work, manages the resources, and ensures the building is completed according to the architect's plans.

**In essence, effective leadership often incorporates strong management skills.** A leader with a great vision but poor management skills may struggle to achieve their goals. Conversely, a good manager without leadership skills may be able to maintain the status quo but fail to inspire innovation or drive significant change.

**Therefore, while management is a critical component of effective leadership, it doesn't encompass the full scope of what leadership is.**
