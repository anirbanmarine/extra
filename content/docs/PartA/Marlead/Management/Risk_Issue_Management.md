Risk and issue management are two distinct but related processes in project management. They both aim to minimize negative impacts on a project, but they differ in their focus and timing.

**Risk Management**

*   **Proactive:** Focuses on identifying, analyzing, and responding to potential future events that could impact the project.
*   **Focus:** Aims to prevent problems from occurring or to minimize their impact if they do occur.
*   **Key Activities:**
    *   **Risk Identification:** Identifying potential risks through techniques like brainstorming, SWOT analysis, and expert interviews.
    *   **Risk Analysis:** Assessing the likelihood and impact of each risk.
    *   **Risk Response Planning:** Developing strategies to mitigate, avoid, transfer, or accept risks.
    *   **Risk Monitoring and Control:** Tracking risks and implementing response plans as needed.
*   **Example:** Identifying the risk of a key supplier going out of business and developing a contingency plan to find an alternative supplier.

**Issue Management**

*   **Reactive:** Focuses on addressing problems that have already occurred and are impacting the project.
*   **Focus:** Aims to resolve issues quickly and effectively to minimize disruption.
*   **Key Activities:**
    *   **Issue Identification:** Recognizing and documenting issues as they arise.
    *   **Issue Analysis:** Understanding the cause and impact of each issue.
    *   **Issue Resolution:** Developing and implementing solutions to resolve issues.
    *   **Issue Monitoring:** Tracking the progress of issue resolution and ensuring that solutions are effective.
*   **Example:** Addressing a delay in receiving materials from a supplier by expediting delivery or finding a temporary alternative.

**Here's a table summarizing the key differences:**

| Feature          | Risk Management                               | Issue Management                             |
|-----------------|-----------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| **Timing**        | Proactive (before problems occur)              | Reactive (after problems have occurred)     |
| **Focus**        | Preventing or minimizing potential problems   | Resolving existing problems                 |
| **Nature**        | Uncertain future events                      | Current problems                           |
| **Documentation** | Risk Register                               | Issue Log                                  |

**Relationship between Risk and Issue Management**

*   **Risks can turn into issues:** If a risk event occurs, it becomes an issue that needs to be addressed.
*   **Lessons learned:** Issues can provide valuable lessons for future risk management planning.
*   **Integrated approach:** Effective project management requires both proactive risk management and reactive issue management.

In essence, risk management is about anticipating and preparing for potential problems, while issue management is about dealing with problems that have already arisen. Both are essential for successful project outcomes.
