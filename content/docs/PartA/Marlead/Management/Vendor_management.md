It encompasses all activities involved in identifying, selecting, contracting with, and managing vendors to ensure they meet the organization's needs and expectations.

**Key aspects of vendor management:**

*   **Vendor Selection:** Identifying potential vendors, evaluating their capabilities, and selecting the best fit based on factors like price, quality, reliability, and reputation.

*   **Onboarding:** Integrating new vendors into the organization's systems and processes.
*   **Performance Monitoring:** Tracking vendor performance against agreed-upon metrics and SLAs.
*   **Relationship Management:** Building and maintaining strong relationships with vendors to foster collaboration and mutual success.
*   **Risk Management:** Identifying and mitigating potential risks associated with vendor relationships, such as financial instability, data breaches, or supply chain disruptions.
*   **Compliance:** Ensuring vendors comply with relevant regulations and industry standards.
*   **Offboarding:** Managing the termination of vendor relationships in a smooth and efficient manner.

**Benefits of effective vendor management:**
