Making entries in the **balance sheet** involves recording the financial position of a business at a specific point in time. The balance sheet follows the **accounting equation**:

> **Assets = Liabilities + Equity**

To make entries in the balance sheet, you need to classify and record all **assets**, **liabilities**, and **equity** accounts. Here's how to do it step by step:

## ðŸ“Œ Step-by-Step Guide to Making Entries in the Balance Sheet

### 1. **Understand the Components of the Balance Sheet**
The balance sheet has three main sections:

#### A. **Assets**
These are resources owned by the company that have economic value.

- **Current Assets**: Can be converted into cash within one year (e.g., cash, accounts receivable, inventory).
- **Non-Current Assets**: Long-term assets (e.g., property, plant & equipment, intangible assets).

#### B. **Liabilities**
These are obligations the company owes to others.

- **Current Liabilities**: Due within one year (e.g., accounts payable, short-term loans).
- **Non-Current Liabilities**: Not due for more than one year (e.g., long-term debt, deferred tax liabilities).

#### C. **Equity**
This is the ownerâ€™s or shareholdersâ€™ stake in the company.

- Includes **common stock**, **retained earnings**, and **additional paid-in capital**.

### 2. **Gather Financial Data**

- Accounts receivable and payable reports
- Inventory records
- Loan agreements

### 3. **Classify Each Account**
Ensure each account is correctly classified as an asset, liability, or equity item.

|----------------------|-------------|
| Cash                 | Asset       |
| Accounts Receivable  | Asset       |
| Inventory            | Asset       |
| Accounts Payable     | Liability   |
| Loans Payable        | Liability   |
| Common Stock         | Equity      |
| Retained Earnings    | Equity      |

```

### 5. **Record the Amounts**
Enter the correct amounts under each category based on your accounting records.

Example:

```
Cash: $10,000  
Accounts Receivable: $5,000  
Inventory: $8,000  
Total Current Assets: $23,000  

Property, Plant & Equipment: $50,000  
Accumulated Depreciation: ($10,000)  
Total Non-Current Assets: $40,000  

Total Assets: $63,000  

Accounts Payable: $7,000  
Short-Term Debt: $3,000  
Total Current Liabilities: $10,000  

Long-Term Debt: $15,000  
Total Non-Current Liabilities: $15,000  

Total Liabilities: $25,000  

Common Stock: $20,000  
Retained Earnings: $18,000  
Total Equity: $38,000  

Total Liabilities and Equity: $63,000
```

### 6. **Verify the Accounting Equation**
Always check that:

> **Assets = Liabilities + Equity**

In the example above:  
$63,000 = $25,000 + $38,000 âœ…

### 7. **Review and Finalize**
- Check for any errors in classification or amounts.
- Ensure all accounts are included.
- Make sure the date is correct.
