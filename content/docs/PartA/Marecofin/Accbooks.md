These books together ensure that an organization maintains a clear, organized, and auditable trail of all financial activities. Depending on the size and complexity of the business, some companies may consolidate or automate these processes using accounting software (like QuickBooks, Xero, Tally, etc.), but the underlying structure remains the same.
