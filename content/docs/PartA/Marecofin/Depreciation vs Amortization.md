## üîç What is Depreciation?

### üìå Definition:
**Depreciation** is the process of allocating the **cost of a tangible fixed asset** (like machinery, buildings, or vehicles) over its useful life.

### üß© Key Features:
- Applies to **tangible assets** (physical assets).
- Reflects the decline in value due to **use, wear and tear, or obsolescence**.
- Common methods: Straight Line, Written Down Value, Units of Production, etc.

### üìå Example:
A company buys a machine for $50,000 with a 10-year useful life and no salvage value.  
Using straight-line depreciation:

$$
\text{Annual Depreciation} = \frac{50,000 - 0}{10} = \$5,000
$$

So, every year, the company records a $5,000 expense for depreciation.

## üîç What is Amortization?

### üìå Definition:
**Amortization** is the process of allocating the **cost of an intangible asset** (like patents, trademarks, copyrights, or software) over its useful life.

### üß© Key Features:
- Applies to **intangible assets** (non-physical assets).
- Reflects the loss of value over time, often due to **expiration or legal restrictions**.
- Usually follows the **straight-line method**, but can vary.

### üìå Example:
A company acquires a patent for $200,000 with a 20-year useful life.

$$
\text{Annual Amortization} = \frac{200,000 - 0}{20} = \$10,000
$$

So, each year, the company records a $10,000 amortization expense.

## ‚úÖ Key Differences Between Depreciation and Amortization

| Feature                | **Depreciation**                         | **Amortization**                          |
|------------------------|------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| **Type of Asset**      | Tangible assets (machines, buildings, etc.) | Intangible assets (patents, trademarks, etc.) |
| **Purpose**            | To account for physical wear and tear     | To account for loss of value over time    |
| **Common Method**      | Straight line, reducing balance, units     | Usually straight line                     |
| **Salvage Value**      | May be considered                        | Not typically considered                  |
| **Example**            | A factory building                       | A trademark                               |

## üß† Summary Table

| Term         | Type of Asset | Purpose                             | Method Used       |
|--------------|---------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------|
| Depreciation | Tangible      | Physical wear & tear                | Straight line, etc. |
| Amortization | Intangible    | Loss of value due to expiration     | Straight line     |

## üí° Important Notes:
- **Both are non-cash expenses** that reduce net income.
- They help match the **cost of the asset** with the **revenue it generates** over time.
- In some countries (like the U.S.), **amortization** may also be used for **loan repayments**, which is different from **accounting amortization**.

## üìå When to Use Each:
- Use **depreciation** for **physical assets** like:
  - Buildings
  - Vehicles
  - Equipment
  - Computers
- Use **amortization** for **intangible assets** like:
  - Patents
  - Trademarks
  - Software
  - Licenses

## ‚úÖ Final Thought:
While **depreciation** and **amortization** are similar in purpose (allocating asset cost over time), they differ in the type of asset they apply to. Understanding this distinction is essential for accurate financial reporting and tax compliance.
