Costs can be classified in **multiple ways**, depending on the purpose of classification ‚Äî such as **cost control, decision-making, financial reporting, or performance evaluation**. Here are the most common **ways to classify costs** in accounting and management:

---

## üìö 1. **By Nature (Element)**
This classification groups costs based on what they are spent on.

### ‚úÖ Types:
| Classification | Description | Example |
|----------------|-------------|---------|
| **Materials** | Cost of raw materials or components used in production | Steel, fabric, wood |
| **Labour** | Wages and salaries paid to employees | Factory workers, supervisors |
| **Expenses** | Other costs not related to materials or labour | Rent, utilities, insurance |

---

## üßæ 2. **By Function (in a business)**
This classification organizes costs based on the part of the business where they occur.

### ‚úÖ Types:
| Classification | Description | Example |
|----------------|-------------|---------|
| **Production/Manufacturing Cost** | Costs incurred during manufacturing | Direct materials, factory rent |
| **Administration Cost** | Costs related to general management | Office salaries, admin staff |
| **Selling & Distribution Cost** | Costs incurred to sell and deliver goods | Advertising, transport, sales commission |
| **Research & Development (R&D)** | Costs for developing new products/services | Product testing, prototype development |
| **Finance Cost** | Interest and other finance-related expenses | Loan interest, bank charges |

---

## üîÅ 3. **By Behavior (with changes in activity level)**
How costs behave when the volume of output or activity changes.

### ‚úÖ Types:
| Classification | Description | Behavior |
|----------------|-------------|----------|
| **Fixed Cost** | Remains constant regardless of output | Rent, manager‚Äôs salary |
| **Variable Cost** | Changes directly with output level | Raw materials, direct wages |
| **Semi-variable / Mixed Cost** | Part fixed, part variable | Electricity bill (fixed line rent + usage charge) |

---

## üéØ 4. **By Controllability**
Used in cost management to determine who is responsible for controlling which costs.

### ‚úÖ Types:
| Classification | Description | Example |
|----------------|-------------|---------|
| **Controllable Costs** | Can be influenced by a manager‚Äôs decisions | Labour hours, material usage |
| **Uncontrollable Costs** | Cannot be directly controlled by a manager | Allocated head office costs |

---

## üß© 5. **By Normality**
Refers to whether the cost is expected under normal operating conditions.

### ‚úÖ Types:
| Classification | Description | Example |
|----------------|-------------|---------|
| **Normal Cost** | Expected and unavoidable cost at normal capacity | Regular factory overheads |
| **Abnormal Cost** | Not normally incurred; due to inefficiencies | Idle time, spoilage, theft |

---

## üí° 6. **By Relevance to Decision-Making**
Used in managerial accounting for planning and decision-making.

### ‚úÖ Types:
| Classification | Description | Use Case |
|----------------|-------------|----------|
| **Opportunity Cost** | Benefit foregone by choosing one option over another | Choosing to invest in A instead of B |
| **Sunk Cost** | Past cost that cannot be recovered | Already incurred R&D cost |
| **Incremental / Differential Cost** | Difference in cost between alternatives | Comparing two machines |
| **Avoidable Cost** | Can be eliminated if an activity is stopped | Advertising for a discontinued product |
| **Joint Cost** | Common cost incurred before split-off point | Cost incurred before separating joint products |

---

## üèó 7. **By Inventory Treatment**
Used in financial accounting to determine how costs are treated in inventory valuation.

### ‚úÖ Types:
| Classification | Description | Treated As |
|----------------|-------------|------------|
| **Product Cost** | Directly related to producing goods | Included in inventory value (asset) |
| **Period Cost** | Not tied to production | Expensed in the period incurred (e.g., selling expense) |

---

## üßÆ 8. **Other Classifications**
These are more specialized classifications used in specific contexts.

| Classification | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| **Direct vs Indirect Costs** | - **Direct**: Traceable to a specific product or department (e.g., direct materials)<br> - **Indirect**: Shared across multiple products (e.g., factory overhead) |
| **Standard Cost** | Pre-determined estimated cost used for budgeting and variance analysis |
| **Actual Cost** | Real cost incurred during production |
| **Marginal Cost** | Additional cost of producing one more unit |
| **Imputed Cost** | Notional cost not involving actual cash outflow (e.g., owner's salary if working in own business) |

## üìå Summary Table

| Classification Basis | Main Categories |
|----------------------|-----------------|
| By Nature | Materials, Labour, Expenses |
| By Function | Production, Administration, Selling, R&D, Finance |
| By Behavior | Fixed, Variable, Semi-variable |
| By Controllability | Controllable, Uncontrollable |
| By Normality | Normal, Abnormal |
| By Relevance | Opportunity, Sunk, Incremental, Avoidable, Joint |
| By Inventory Treatment | Product, Period |
| Others | Direct/Indirect, Standard, Actual, Marginal, Imputed |
