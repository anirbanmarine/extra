## ✅ 1. **Straight Line Method (SLM)**

### 📌 Definition:
This is the simplest and most commonly used method. The asset depreciates by the same amount each year.

### 🧮 Formula:

$$
\text{Annual Depreciation} = \frac{\text{Cost of Asset} - \text{Salvage Value}}{\text{Useful Life}}
$$

- **Cost of Asset**: Initial purchase price.
- **Salvage Value**: Estimated value at the end of the asset’s useful life.
- **Useful Life**: Expected number of years the asset will be used.

### 📌 Example:

If a machine costs $10,000, has a salvage value of $2,000, and a useful life of 5 years:

$$
\text{Depreciation} = \frac{10,000 - 2,000}{5} = \frac{8,000}{5} = \$1,600 \text{ per year}
$$

### 💡 Advantages:
- Simple to calculate.
- Provides consistent expense each year.

### ⚠️ Disadvantages:
- Doesn’t reflect the actual usage pattern of the asset.

## ✅ 2. **Written Down Value Method (WDV) / Reducing Balance Method**

### 📌 Definition:
Under this method, depreciation is calculated on the **book value** (original cost minus accumulated depreciation) of the asset each year. The rate is usually higher in the early years and decreases over time.

### 🧮 Formula:

$$
\text{Annual Depreciation} = \text{Book Value} \times \text{Depreciation Rate}
$$

### 📌 Example:

A machine costs $10,000, with a depreciation rate of 20% per annum.

| Year | Book Value | Depreciation | Accumulated Depreciation | Net Book Value |
|------|------------|--------------|--------------------------|----------------|
| 1    | $10,000    | $2,000       | $2,000                   | $8,000         |
| 2    | $8,000     | $1,600       | $3,600                   | $6,400         |
| 3    | $6,400     | $1,280       | $4,880                   | $5,120         |

### 💡 Advantages:
- Reflects the fact that assets lose more value early in their life.
- Matches revenue with expenses better for tax purposes.

### ⚠️ Disadvantages:
- Not suitable for all types of assets (e.g., land).

## ✅ 3. **Units of Production Method**

### 📌 Definition:
Depreciation is based on the **actual usage** of the asset rather than time.

### 🧮 Formula:

$$
\text{Depreciation per Unit} = \frac{\text{Cost of Asset} - \text{Salvage Value}}{\text{Total Estimated Units}}
$$

$$
\text{Annual Depreciation} = \text{Depreciation per Unit} \times \text{Units Produced}
$$

### 📌 Example:

Machine costs $10,000, salvage value $1,000, estimated production: 9,000 units.

$$
\text{Depreciation per unit} = \frac{10,000 - 1,000}{9,000} = \frac{9,000}{9,000} = \$1 \text{ per unit}
$$

If 1,000 units are produced in a year:

$$
\text{Depreciation} = 1,000 \times 1 = \$1,000
$$

### 💡 Advantages:
- Accurate when usage varies significantly from year to year.

### ⚠️ Disadvantages:
- Requires accurate estimates of total units.

## ✅ 4. **Double Declining Balance Method (DDB)**

### 📌 Definition:
An accelerated depreciation method where the depreciation rate is double the straight-line rate.

### 🧮 Formula:

$$
\text{Depreciation Rate} = \frac{2}{\text{Useful Life}} \times 100
$$

Then apply it to the book value each year.

### 📌 Example:

Asset costs $10,000, useful life 5 years.

$$
\text{Rate} = \frac{2}{5} = 40\%
$$

| Year | Book Value | Depreciation | Accumulated Depreciation | Net Book Value |
|------|------------|--------------|--------------------------|----------------|
| 1    | $10,000    | $4,000       | $4,000                   | $6,000         |
| 2    | $6,000     | $2,400       | $6,400                   | $3,600         |
| 3    | $3,600     | $1,440       | $7,840                   | $2,160         |

### 💡 Advantages:
- Useful for assets that lose value quickly.

### ⚠️ Disadvantages:
- Can result in negative book value if not adjusted.

## ✅ 5. **Sum of Years’ Digits Method (SYD)**

### 📌 Definition:
Another accelerated method where depreciation is based on the sum of the digits of the asset's useful life.

### 🧮 Formula:

$$
\text{Depreciation} = \left( \frac{\text{Remaining Useful Life}}{\text{Sum of Years' Digits}} \right) \times (\text{Cost} - \text{Salvage Value})
$$

### 📌 Example:

Asset costs $10,000, salvage $1,000, useful life 5 years.

Sum of years = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15

| Year | Remaining Life | Depreciation | Accumulated Depreciation | Net Book Value |
|------|----------------|--------------|--------------------------|----------------|
| 1    | 5              | $3,000       | $3,000                   | $7,000         |
| 2    | 4              | $2,400       | $5,400                   | $4,600         |
| 3    | 3              | $1,800       | $7,200                   | $2,800         |
| 4    | 2              | $1,200       | $8,400                   | $1,600         |
| 5    | 1              | $600         | $9,000                   | $1,000         |

### 💡 Advantages:
- Accelerated depreciation, similar to DDB.

### ⚠️ Disadvantages:
- More complex calculations.
