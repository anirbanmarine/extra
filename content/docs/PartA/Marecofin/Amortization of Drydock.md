## 🧩 What is Drydocking?

**Drydocking** is the process of **removing a ship from water** to perform **maintenance, repairs, and inspections**. It’s a major expense that occurs **every few years**, depending on the type of vessel and regulatory requirements.

---

## 🧠 Why is Drydocking Expense Amortized?

### 1. **It's a Non-Recurring, Large Expense**
Drydocking is not an **annual** expense — it happens every **3–5 years**. If you were to **record the full cost in one year**, it would distort the company's **profitability** for that year and make it hard to compare performance across periods.

### 2. **Matching Principle (Accounting Concept)**
Under the **accrual basis of accounting**, expenses should be **matched with the revenues they help generate**.

- Drydocking improves the **operational efficiency and safety** of the vessel.
- The benefits of drydocking are spread over several years.
- Therefore, the cost should be **allocated over the period** during which the asset (the ship) continues to provide economic benefits.

### 3. **Amortization as a Method of Allocation**
Instead of recognizing the full cost in one year, companies **amortize** the drydocking expense over the **number of years between drydockings**.

For example:
- If a ship undergoes drydocking every 4 years and the cost is $100,000,
- Then each year, the company would record a **$25,000 amortization expense** ($100,000 ÷ 4).

## 📊 How is This Treated in Financial Statements?

### ✅ In the **Income Statement**:
- A **yearly amortization expense** is recorded (e.g., $25,000 per year).
- This avoids a huge dip in profits during the drydocking year.

### ✅ In the **Balance Sheet**:
- The remaining unamortized portion of the drydocking cost is shown as a **liability or an asset**, depending on how it's treated.
  - If the expense has been paid in advance (i.e., cash was paid before the drydocking), it might be listed as a **prepaid expense (asset)**.
  - If the expense hasn't been paid yet, it might be listed as a **liability (provision or accrued expense)**.

## 🔍 Example Scenario

| Year | Drydocking Cost | Amortization Expense | Unamortized Balance |
|------|------------------|-----------------------|---------------------|
| 2020 | $100,000         | $25,000               | $75,000             |
| 2021 | –                | $25,000               | $50,000             |
| 2022 | –                | $25,000               | $25,000             |
| 2023 | –                | $25,000               | $0                  |

In this case, the full $100,000 is amortized over 4 years.

## 🧠 Key Takeaways

| Aspect | Explanation |
|--------|-------------|
| **Why amortize?** | To match the expense with the benefit over time, not just in the year it occurs. |
| **Impact on Income Statement** | Smooths out earnings by spreading the cost over multiple years. |
| **Impact on Balance Sheet** | Shows the remaining obligation or prepaid amount related to future drydocking. |
| **Regulatory Requirement** | Some industries (like shipping) require regular drydocking, making this practice standard. |

## ✅ Summary

> **Drydocking expenses are amortized** in the yearly financial statements to **reflect the true cost of maintaining the vessel over its useful life**, rather than recognizing the entire expense in the year it occurs. This approach follows the **matching principle** and ensures more accurate and consistent financial reporting.
