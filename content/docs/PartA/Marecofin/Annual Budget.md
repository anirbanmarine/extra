Sample annual budget sheet for a crude oil tanker shipping company with two Suezmax and one Aframax tramp vessel. I've included the critical income and expense heads. Keep in mind that this is a template, and actual figures will vary significantly based on market conditions, company-specific factors, and accounting practices.
Assumptions:
1.Vessel Employment:
  - Suezmax vessels: Primarily operating in the spot market, with some time charter contracts.
  - Aframax vessel: Operating in the spot market.
2.Voyage Estimation: Assumes an average number of voyages per year for each vessel type, considering factors like loading/unloading times, ballast voyages, and potential waiting times.
3.Freight Rates: Based on an estimated average freight rate per ton, which is highly volatile.
    -Currency: USD
    -Tramp Vessel: Operates in the spot market.
